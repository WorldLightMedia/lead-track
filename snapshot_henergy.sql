On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there''s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you?

The video player is now responsive and adjusts well to mobile devices. Videos can be embedded anywhere and are easier to share, thanks to permalinks.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a couple of neat options for sharing videos. Similar to YouTube, you can select a time stamp where the video will start playing. You can also loop and autoplay videos.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/VideoPressSharingOptions.png"><img class="wp-image-46114 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/VideoPressSharingOptions.png?resize=566%2C319" alt="VideoPress Sharing Options" /></a>VideoPress Sharing Options\n<p>One thing I noticed is that pasting a VideoPress permalink into the self hosted WordPress visual editor does not load the video. This is because WordPress does not have <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">oEmbed support</a> for VideoPress.</p>\n<p>To embed videos into posts, you need to copy the HTML embed code from the video and past it into the WordPress text editor. Pasting the code into the visual editor doesn&#8217;t work. Guillermo Rauch, who works on the VideoPress team at Automattic says they are <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/videopress-next/?c=221756#comment-221760">working on adding oEmbed support</a>.</p>\n<p>The new video player takes up little space and is unbranded. According to Rauch, the player’s skin and behavior is controlled by JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This opens the door for customizations by theme developers in the future. Thanks to major performance enhancements, pages with videos on them will load faster, even for those on slow internet connections. Here&#8217;s an example of a video using the new player.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A feature that I think a lot of people will enjoy is real-time seek which lets you skim through videos and helps you start playing at a desired point. Last but not least, the libraries used to build the new video player have been open sourced, including <a href="https://github.com/automattic/jpeg-stream">jpeg-stream</a>, <a href="https://github.com/automattic/pixel-stack">pixel-stack</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/automattic/video-thumb-grid">video-thumb-grid</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in using VideoPress, you need a <a href="https://wordpress.com/plans/">Premium or Business</a> plan on WordPress.com. The premium plan is $99 per year and includes 13GB of space. Videos take up a lot of space and one has to wonder if it&#8217;s worth the cost or if YouTube is a better option. If you use VideoPress, let us know what you think of these improvements.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 03 Jul 2015 03:46:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"Matt: Domain Anonymity and the Brilliance of Entertainment Lobbyists";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45202";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://ma.tt/2015/07/domain-anonymity-and-the-brilliance-of-entertainment-lobbyists/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1747:"<blockquote><p>To rid the internet of piracy, entertainment companies are willing to greatly reduce privacy, at least where website registration is concerned.</p>\n<p>Where the entertainment industry views proxy registration as a pirate’s tool for obfuscation, privacy advocates see identity concealment as a feature that can enable free speech and freedom from harassment.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/hamzashaban/proposed-domain-name-rule-threatens-website-owner-anonymity">a new proposal to force any &#8220;commercial&#8221; website, which could cover pretty much anything, to have real WHOIS/contact info</a>.

Lasso, a plugin originally designed to improve the experience of using of <a href="http://aesopstoryengine.com/" target="_blank">Aesop Story Engine</a>, is currently one of the most user-friendly and well-supported attempts at bringing frontend editing to WordPress.</p>\n<p>The plugin works with or without Aesop Story Engine. Lasso brings a minimal, unobtrusive approach to editing that keeps the focus on content creation. Haskins hopes to ship <a href="https://lasso.is/the-road-to-version-one/" target="_blank">version 1.0</a> of the plugin this fall, and the source was recently <a href="http://wptavern.com/lasso-frontend-editing-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available-on-github" target="_blank">made available to developers and testers on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is simple: be a front-end editor that negates the use of the WordPress post editor,&#8221; Haskins said. &#8220;One of the last areas to tackle in this endeavor was revisions.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://lasso.is/0-9-6-release-notes/" target="_blank">Lasso 0.9.6</a> allows users to restore revisions in real time while editing a post on the front end. The plugin introduces a new and unique approach to displaying revisions, removing the default &#8220;diff style&#8221; comparison in favor of a simpler sliding interface.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lasso-revisions.gif"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lasso-revisions.gif?resize=948%2C723" alt="lasso-revisions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46097" /></a></p>\n<p>Lasso displays the last six revisions and users can click on the time to restore a revision live. It functions like a little piece of magic on the front end.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because Lasso already operates within the post_content, there wasn&#8217;t really a huge technical challenge to overcome,&#8221; Haskins said. &#8220;The biggest bottle neck was finding a way to do this that would cause no confusion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress revisions use a &#8220;diff style&#8221; comparison, which I don&#8217;t think benefits 80% of WordPress users. After all they&#8217;re not coders. So we decided to restore the post as it was, and most importantly, the context that it lives in,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The live revisions restoring supports images, markup, and everything else that you would expect to be parsed into HTML, but Haskins has a few outstanding items he hopes to polish up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Things like shortcodes and ombeds are not processed into HTML as they need a page refresh, so finding a way to parse these live is just about the only technical challenge that we still have to overcome,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t prevent things from working, but I think a user expects these items to show as they appear on site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the first time a plugin author has done anything like this with revision display and restore.

According to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/" target="_blank">4.3 project schedule</a>, there will be no more commits for new enhancements or feature requests from this point on. Contributors are now focusing on bug fixes and documentation ahead of August 18th, the target release date.</p>\n<p>With all the controversy surrounding WordPress 4.3&#8217;s inclusion of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576" target="_blank">menus in the customizer</a>, you may have missed a few other lesser known features that are on track to be included and need to be put through the paces. The <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this" target="_blank">new site icons feature</a> was added to trunk this week, along with a text editor for the Press This posting interface.</p>\n<p>WordPress lead developer Mark Jaquith has been working on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589" target="_blank">making passwords more secure</a>. As of 4.3, WordPress will no longer send passwords via email. The password strength meter is now more tightly integrated. It will warn users upon selection of a weak password and can also suggest a secure password.</p>\n<p>One interesting new improvement added to the post editor is <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441" target="_blank">recognition of some basic markdown-esque patterns inside TinyMCE</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including * and &#8211; transforming into unordered lists, 1. and 1) for ordered lists, > for blockquotes and one to six number signs (#) for headings</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those who are used to formatting text this way, the post editor in WordPress 4.3. will be a more friendly place for speedy composition.</p>\n<p>Admin post and page <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395" target="_blank">list tables</a> will take a huge leap forward to become more responsive in this release, improving the experience of using WordPress on smaller screens. Previously, the columns that could not fit were truncated, but WordPress 4.3 will allow columns to be toggled into view.</p>\n<p>Check out release lead Konstantin Obenland&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/" target="_blank">beta announcement</a> post to download a zip of the beta.

Most developers are far more familiar with Git. It&#8217;s not difficult to learn how to use SVN for the sake of WordPress.org plugins, but many find it to be inconvenient.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ship.getherbert.com/" target="_blank">Ship</a> is a new application designed to eliminate this hassle by helping developers ship plugins directly from GitHub to WordPress.org. All you have to do is tag the release on GitHub and the app will automatically push updates to the plugin&#8217;s official SVN repo on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ship.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ship.png?resize=1025%2C641" alt="ship" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46026" /></a></p>\n<p>The application was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonagnew__" target="_blank">Jason Agnew</a> and his team at <a href="http://bigbitecreative.com/" target="_blank">Big Bite Creative</a>, authors of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/herbert-a-new-wordpress-plugin-framework" target="_blank">Herbert plugin framework</a>. The team built the app in Laravel in just five days. It&#8217;s currently hosted on Digital Ocean, but Agnew plans to move it over to AWS once Ship has gained more users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve reached a point where most developers are familiar with GitHub, and as a result, Git,&#8221; Agnew said in his <a href="http://bigbitecreative.com/introducing-ship-publishing-your-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank">announcement</a>. &#8220;If you plan to do anything open source you’re likely to find yourself on there &#8211; even Apple has made the move. Unfortunately WordPress.org uses SVN, which most developers don’t use daily, or are even familiar with. It’s easy enough to pick up, but why should you learn something new to update your plugin?&#8221;</p>\n<p>With the help of the Ship app, developers won&#8217;t have to touch SVN at all during the process of sending updates to WordPress.org plugin repositories.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For years most plugin developers have used GitHub and then shipped to WordPress.org SVN using a bash script,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;You’ll find plenty out there, but they require you to keep both a Git and SVN repo on your machine — plus you need to remember to run it every time you tag a new release. We thought there must be a simpler way to do this, so we put our heads together. After a few days we had put together the first version of Ship.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to use the app you must have already <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/add/" target="_blank">submitted your plugin zip file to WordPress.org</a>. You can then sign into the <a href="http://ship.getherbert.com/" target="_blank">Ship</a> app with GitHub and authorize its access to your repositories.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/authorize-ship-app.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/authorize-ship-app.jpg?resize=716%2C434" alt="authorize-ship-app" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46044" /></a></p>\n<p>The app will then fetch your repositories and you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to select the ones you want to link up with a WordPress.org SVN address in order to start syncing updates.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ship-sync-reops.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ship-sync-reops.jpg?resize=842%2C525" alt="ship-sync-reops" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46046" /></a></p>\n<p>Big Bite Creative has built many custom plugins over the years, but Agnew said they never had the time to open source them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now with Herbert out there we want to start releasing more plugins on Github &#8211; Ship is part of making that process easier,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In the future, Agnew and his team would like to eliminate the need to first submit your plugin on WordPress.org and instead have that process initiated by Ship. They used &#8220;Sign in with GitHub&#8221; to save time when initially building the app but would also like to open it up for other services like BitBucket.</p>\n<p>The new Ship app effectively gets around WordPress.org&#8217;s SVN requirement for plugin repos, which has long been a minor deterrent and annoyance for developers wanting to host their work in the directory. If Ship is successful in making plugin developer&#8217;s lives easier, the result will be more open source extensions available to WordPress users. Agnew and his team welcome feedback on the app and have created <a href="https://github.com/getherbert/ship" target="_blank">an empty repo on GiHub</a> to capture any suggestions or issues.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Jul 2015 01:13:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: Which One of These Six Cities Should Host WordCamp US?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=46027";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://wptavern.com/which-one-of-these-six-cities-should-host-wordcamp-us";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1498:"<p>When Matt Mullenweg <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2015-now-accepting-applications-for-host-city">put out the call</a> to cities interested in hosting WordCamp US, we learned the criteria they would have to meet in order to qualify.

Unfortunately, text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the problem. We as a community need to approach discussions with open minds.

Favicons have traditionally been handled by WordPress themes or plugins, but the new core support means that users no longer have to hunt down an extension to handle this basic site feature.</p>\n<p>This addition landed in 4.3 in response to a four-year old trac <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434" target="_blank">ticket</a> requesting an easier way for non-technical users to upload and crop an image to use as a favicon. Konstantin Obenland, release lead for 4.3, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/32994" target="_blank">committed the feature to WordPress trunk</a> this week, along with the following summary of its current capabilities:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This v1 marries Jetpack&#8217;s Site Icon module with the Media Modal, reusing code from the Custom Header admin. For now, the core-provided icons will be limited to a favicon, an iOS app icon, and a Windows tile icon, leaving .ico support and additional icons to plugins to add.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After testing WordPress 4.3-alpha, I found that the experience of adding a favicon in the settings panel is smoother and more intuitive than any plugin I&#8217;ve ever tried. The screen offers users a nice preview of the image as a favicon and mobile icon. It also doesn&#8217;t burden you with any notices about sizes and image quality, unless you attempt to upload an image that is less than 512px in width.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordpress-site-icon.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordpress-site-icon.jpg?resize=848%2C691" alt="wordpress-site-icon" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46000" /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to test the feature, you can provide feedback on the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434" target="_blank">ticket</a> or via the announcement <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/30/today-in-the-nightly-site-icons-text-editor-in-press-this/" target="_blank">post</a>.</p>\n<p>Another major enhancement added to 4.3 this week is a text editor for Press This. Many WordPress users appreciate the streamlined simplicity of the Press This post editor but were held back from using it to compose posts due to the lack of HTML editing support. The addition of a text editor offers the same capabilities as the standard editor in <em>post-new.php</em>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/press-this-text-editor.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/press-this-text-editor.jpg?resize=1025%2C466" alt="press-this-text-editor" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46007" /></a></p>\n<p>Press This will also receive a few <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/32999" target="_blank">polishes</a> in addition to the text editor, including auto-scrolling when the caret moves out of the viewport while the user is typing (similar to editor-expand) and auto-resizing for the textarea.

His patch offers developers an easy way to enable the &#8216;no-customizer-support&#8217; class within the body tag.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Due to the fact that the &#8216;customizer-support&#8217; class is added via JavaScript on page render, it cannot be manipulated using any core filters or actions currently.</p>\n<p>By setting the filter value to false, the Customizer is essentially hidden from the admin and the links that were currently pointing at the Customizer (widgets, themes, etc&#8230;) are reverted to their previous dashboard destinations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Currently, developers who want to disable the customizer have to employ a combination of different methods in order to effectively remove everything that the customizer introduces into the admin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This filter makes this process into a simple boolean filter so that developers who do not want or need the Customizer can easily remove it,&#8221; Shackle said.</p>\n<p>WordPress lead developer <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dd32" target="_blank">Dion Hulse</a> replied to the ticket to say that although he doesn&#8217;t use the customizer much himself, he doesn&#8217;t think that WordPress users would benefit from an easy way to turn it off.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Personally as much as I don&#8217;t use the customizer a lot of the time, I think offering a filter to disable it is probably not in the best interests of WordPress users.</p>\n<p>The customizer, as much as some dislike it, is a major component of the future of WordPress UX &#8211; whether that is a good or bad thing remains to be seen by some &#8211; but like it or hate it, it&#8217;s here.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hulse <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32772#comment:1" target="_blank">suggested</a>, as an alternative, that a better way to disable it would be to remove the <code>customize</code> capability from the roles.</p>\n<p>Shackle further explained that he was attempting to follow the precedent of the admin bar, which he considers to be a similar type of UX component.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Admin Bar can be disabled not only by a filter but by a global variable, core function, and user profile setting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Customizer has none of these options.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nick Halsey, the developer of the Menu Customizer plugin that is being merged into 4.3, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32772#comment:3" target="_blank">replied</a> based on assumptions about why Shackle might request a filter to disable the feature:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have yet to see a valid reason for something like this. In most cases, concerns about not wanting users to have access to the Customizer stem from the fact that you&#8217;re not giving them the appropriate capabilities. And the customize capability can be used to turn off the Customizer if you really must.</p>\n<p>While you can remove the customize meta capability (or re-map it or whatever), doing so simply because you don&#8217;t want to train users or don&#8217;t want to use the Customizer is doing yourself and your users an enormous disservice. As dd32 mentioned, the Customizer will only continue to grow in importance within WordPress. Additionally, user testing has shown that the Customizer experience is generally easier for users to grasp than the admin, which largely stems from the value of having live-previewing available. We&#8217;re putting a significant amount of time into the Customizer every release to continue improving it, conducting frequent user tests along the way to optimize usability.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Halsey promptly closed the ticket following this exchange. I followed up with Shackle to find out why the proposed alternative to remove the <code>customize</code> capability is inadequate for his purposes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mostly I was hoping that the Customizer could be treated more like the admin bar, which has 3+ methods for disabling it,&#8221; Shackle said. &#8220;Having a clearly labeled filter is, in my opinion, more legible than modifying user capabilities. A PHP developer with virtually no WordPress knowledge could most likely understand much quicker what&#8217;s happening with a filter named &#8216;enable_customizer_support&#8217; rather than &#8216;map_meta_cap&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Obviously, not all tickets and patches will be considered valid by the maintainers of WordPress core components, but Shackle was disappointed by the defensive response to the discussion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, had the reply simply been something along the lines of &#8216;You should just use the <code>customize</code> capability to achieve the same effect&#8217; I really wouldn&#8217;t have had any issue,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, it seems any approach other than &#8216;Customizer for all things!&#8217; means I get to be told multiple times how much of a disservice I&#8217;m doing my clients and what a lazy developer I am for not just re-training my clients how to manage their sites&#8217; appearance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It feels like the Customizer team themselves have an all-or-nothing approach to the project and that anyone who questions this is wrong, regardless of their reasoning,&#8221; Shackle said.</p>\n<p>This exchange demonstrates that since core contributors view the customizer as a major part of the future of WordPress, this is one feature where there will be little willingness to support efforts to make it more modular. Disabling support for the customizer will continue to require use of &#8216;map_meta_cap,&#8217; the same <a href="https://github.com/parallelus/customizer-remove-all-parts/blob/master/wp-crap.php#L75" target="_blank">method</a> the creators of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-removes-all-traces-of-the-customizer-in-wordpress" target="_blank">Customizer Remove All Parts</a> plugin have employed.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 23:08:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"WPTavern: UpThemes Adds Managed WordPress Hosting to Theme Club Business";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45775";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"http://wptavern.com/upthemes-adds-managed-wordpress-hosting-to-theme-club-business";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4711:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/upthemes.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/upthemes.jpg?resize=665%2C300" alt="upthemes" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45946" /></a></p>\n<p>After five years of selling themes and support, UpThemes is branching out into the managed WordPress hosting business. Last week the company <a href="https://upthemes.com/blog/2015/06/upthemes-hosting/" target="_blank">announced</a> the new hosting venture and partnership with <a href="http://aesopstoryengine.com/" target="_blank">Aesop Interactive</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are excited to announce UpThemes Hosting, a managed WordPress hosting solution that includes 40+ premium WordPress themes including our entire theme library, all themes from the collection of Aesop Interactive (makers of Aesop Story Engine), as well as a curated selection of beautifully-designed themes from WordPress.org.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For <a href="https://upthemes.com/hosting/" target="_blank">$20/month</a> customers can host one WordPress site with 5GB disk space and 100GB monthly bandwith. Tech support is included along with 40+ commercial themes from UpThemes and Aesop Interactive. Users have control over their sites as they would with a standard WordPress installation, i.e. FTP access, ability to install plugins and themes, etc.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/upthemes-hosting.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/upthemes-hosting.png?resize=640%2C647" alt="upthemes-hosting" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45944" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;This is actually a partnership with <a href="http://www.pressed.net/" target="_blank">Pressed.net</a>, a division of <a href="http://www.site5.com/p/wordpress/" target="_blank">Site5</a>, that sits on top of their managed WordPress hosting architecture,&#8221; UpThemes co-founder Chris Wallace told the Tavern. &#8220;We&#8217;ve looked at many opportunities for a hosting partnership over the years and none of the options felt quite right to us, so we waited until there was one that provided our customers with the best hosting service and support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Site5 understood that need and we&#8217;ve worked hand-in-hand for many months to finally release this product. We&#8217;re very proud of it and think it provides more value than the typical WordPress hosting product.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The hybrid combination of hosting plus a theme club is fairly unique in the WordPress ecosystem, but Wallace believes it provides an easier path for UpThemes customers looking to build an online presence.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our audience is mainly DIYers who just need a site up and running,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always been looking to make it as easy as possible to purchase and install an UpThemes theme so a hosting platform where all our themes are pre-installed seemed like the perfect solution to the problem of &#8216;which theme do I pick&#8217; and &#8216;how do I install a theme&#8217; and &#8216;will your theme work on my webhost?''&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new hosting product also helps UpThemes deal with the financial volatility and unpredictability of managing a theme club business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From a business perspective, selling themes alone has always made it difficult to pin down our customer acquisition cost and churn rate (meaning the number of customers who stop paying their annual renewals),&#8221; Wallace said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since we offer an annual license, we don&#8217;t know if a customer will renew for a whole year, which, as you can imagine, makes it hard to know the lifetime value of the customer. It&#8217;s a hard thing to analyze. Some people care enough to renew but most people don&#8217;t understand the value enough to care.&#8221;</p>\n<p>UpThemes will continue to serve the small business and DIY market and Wallace hopes to add more journalists, storytellers, and photographers with the new Aesop Interactive partnership.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond our new hosting venture, we also serve thousands of blogs on WordPress.com, which helps us offer a one-click method of buying and using our themes without any sort of installation required,&#8221; Wallace said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that really is one of the key points for us: closing the gap on how much knowledge you need to use our themes. We&#8217;d like to make it even easier for certain types of customers (e-commerce, for example) to hit the ground running.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are so many variables to creating a successful online business and we just want to give less technical WordPress users an easier path to success.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 17:54:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Matt: Loyalists vs Mercenaries";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45198";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/loyalists-vs-mercenaries/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:853:"<blockquote><p>Finally, think about being somewhere other than the Bay Area or NYC.

The process can involve getting recommendations from friends, searching Google for reviews, and taking advantage of trial offers. Since 2005, WordPress.org has had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050913180027/http://wordpress.org/hosting/">recommended hosts page</a> featuring companies that meet certain criteria.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressRecommendedHosts2005.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-45906" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressRecommendedHosts2005.png?resize=761%2C841" alt="WordPress.org Recommended Host Page in 2005" /></a>WordPress.org Recommended Host Page in 2005\n<p>Over the years, new companies would rarely be added to the page. For several years, <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost</a>, <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/home.2.html">DreamHost</a>, and <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/">Laughing Squid</a> were the only companies listed.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RecommendedHostsIn2014.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-45907" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RecommendedHostsIn2014.png?resize=727%2C600" alt="Recommend Hosts Page in 2014" /></a>Recommend Hosts Page in 2014\n<p>I&#8217;ve spoken to a number of people in the webhosting industry in the last two years and the general consensus is that, to get on the list, you need to pay Matt Mullenweg a lot of money, which isn&#8217;t true. Bluehost is often used as an example as they&#8217;re owned by <a href="http://www.endurance.com/">Endurance International Group</a> who <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/05/prweb11874425.htm">invested in Automattic</a> in 2014. Bluehost has been on the list since 2005, long before any investment took place.</p>\n<h2>A Fresh Start to The Recommended Hosts Page</h2>\n<p>Currently, Bluehost is the only recommended webhost <a href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/">on the</a><a href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/"> page</a> because it&#8217;s going through a revamp. Near the bottom of the page is a paragraph that admits a lot has changed in the industry over the years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Much has changed in the hosting world since this page was originally set up. There are now many types of dedicated and cloud accounts that are as easy as shared hosting was a generation ago, and shared and managed hosts have evolved significantly to become more tailored to WordPress. WordPress is often now the most commonly used application on major web hosts!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Mullenweg if hosts that were on the page before are eligible to be re-added, &#8220;Of course, anyone is up for consideration and Bluehost is up for being removed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WordPress.org team is starting over from scratch and as such, webhosting companies are asked to complete <a href="http://mcm.polldaddy.com/s/2015-wordpress-hosting-survey">the following</a> survey by <strong>July 31st</strong>.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FirstPageofTheSurvey.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-45908" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FirstPageofTheSurvey.png?resize=616%2C415" alt="First Page of The Survey" /></a>First Page of The Survey\n<p>The survey is 40 questions long and includes questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What&#8217;s the WordPress-specific landing page you&#8217;d want /hosting to point to?</li>\n<li>What type of customers do you target?</li>\n<li>Please describe your technology stack, and why you like it.</li>\n<li>Is 100% of the code included or promoted with your WordPress install GPL or compatible?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It may seem like a tedious process, but those I&#8217;ve spoken to in the past affiliated with companies once on the list say it generates thousands to millions of dollars in signups. This should motivate companies to complete the survey accurately. Even if a company is not listed on the page, those who fill out the survey will be giving WordPress.org a lot of information that may come in handy for other uses.</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s About Time</h2>\n<p>The recommended hosting page is long overdue for a revamp. There are companies such as, A2 Hosting, Pagely, WP Engine, InMotion Hosting, and countless others that are doing a great job hosting large and small WordPress sites. Perhaps it&#8217;s time they become the ones recommended instead of the standard three.

Although Theme Hybrid&#8217;s plugins and themes have always been free, standard club membership (which includes access to the support forums), was previously $25/year.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/steering-the-ship-back-home" target="_blank">Steering the Ship Back Home</a>,&#8221; Tadlock explains his original purpose for the club. Theme Hybrid entered the WordPress theme market with free, open source products back in the day when very few commercial theme sellers were fully adopting the GPL.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I first laid the groundwork for Theme Hybrid, or <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/05/31/project-m" target="_blank">Project M</a> as it was originally called, seven awesome years ago, the idea was to face off against &#8216;premium&#8217; theme authors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to provide a free alternative to the marketplace and show that it could work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock described how, overall, the Theme Hybrid experience has been positive, but during the past year he faced creative blocks, burnout, and a lack of focus. As part of regaining motivation, he decided to refocus Theme Hybrid back to its radical roots.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I always knew I wanted to provide awesome free/$free WordPress themes and plugins,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However, $free doesn’t exactly put food on the table. While seven years has been a good run, I don’t think I ever found the right balance between philosophy and practical concerns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As part of a fresh start, Tadlock is opening up his club membership in an effort to expand the community that has kept the site going over the years. In addition to the free memberships, which provide access to the forums, he is also slashing prices on the tiered memberships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, I have at least a couple of months of wiggle room to try something new while figuring out the direction I want to take the business aspect of this site,&#8221; Tadlock said.</p>\n<p>Theme Hybrid&#8217;s radical shift in club pricing is another example of WordPress businesses giving away more for free, whether it be <a href="http://wptavern.com/lasso-frontend-editing-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available-on-github" target="_blank">commercial products on GitHub</a>, a <a href="http://wptavern.com/all-official-easy-digital-downloads-themes-are-now-100-free" target="_blank">suite of e-commerce themes</a>, or <a href="http://wptavern.com/wpsessions-changes-pricing-structure-live-events-are-now-100-free" target="_blank">live training events</a>.</p>\n<p>Theme Hybrid has always erred on the side of providing free products and tutorials for the community, as opposed to locking them up. Will giving away more for free translate into a higher number of people willing to pay for support? This question is at the core of the freemium business model, the boundaries of which Tadlock has been willing to push for the past seven years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While trying new things is certainly frightening, I’m excited about some of the prospects,&#8221; he said.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 21:45:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: Vienna, Austria to Host WordCamp Europe 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45834";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://wptavern.com/vienna-austria-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4764:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wceu-2016-announcement.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wceu-2016-announcement.png?resize=1022%2C511" alt="photo credit: RubenSutiloFoto" class="size-full wp-image-45848" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/how-we-selected-vienna-the-wordcamp-europe-2016-host-city/">RubenSutiloFoto</a>\n<p>The local WordPress community in Seville welcomed a diverse group of attendees to <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2015</a> over the weekend.

Applications for the host city were <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-now-taking-applications-for-2016-host-city" target="_blank">opened</a> in March and <a href="http://wptavern.com/applications-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2016-closing-soon" target="_blank">closed</a> at the end of April.</p>\n<p>The WordCamp Europe organization team received strong applications from the WordPress communities in Vienna, Bratislava, and Berlin. Some of the most important criteria in the selection process included organizer experience, location, venue, contributor day, and budget.</p>\n<p>Berlin was ruled out due to lack of experience among the organizers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reason that we ruled out Berlin is that there hasn’t yet been a WordCamp in Berlin and we felt that the team needed more WordCamp organizing experience,&#8221; Siobhan McKeown said in the official <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/how-we-selected-vienna-the-wordcamp-europe-2016-host-city/" target="_blank">announcement</a>. &#8220;We’d love to see a WordCamp Berlin in the future – such a wonderful city needs a wonderful WordCamp.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Berlin has actually hosted three WordCamps in the past, including <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/wordcamps/germany-2010/" target="_blank">WordCamp Germany 2010</a>, WordCamps Berlin <a href="http://wpde.org/wordcamp/" target="_blank">2012</a> and <a href="http://wpcamp.de/" target="_blank">2013</a>, other more weighty factors pushed Bratislava and Vienna ahead as potential host cities.</p>\n<p>Bratislava brought a strong and diverse local team to the table, but Vienna ultimately surpassed the other applicants when it came down to logistics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, the venue, location, and available dates for the WordCamp won out,&#8221; McKeown said. &#8220;We loved the Bratislava application, but none of the venues were completely suitable for our event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The venue in Vienna, however, was perfect. We also have 100% confidence in the Vienna local team: they organized a successful WordCamp Vienna in 2015, and Paolo Belcastro, the lead applicant for WordCamp Europe 2016, has been involved in WordCamp Europe for the past three years. This means that the local team will have a leader with a ton of WCEU experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a successful <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2015</a> in the bag, the organization team will now set its sights on Vienna and continue its year round planning efforts. Speaker selection usually begins five or six months in advance for this event, so those planning to apply have plenty of time to prepare.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 17:54:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Obama Delivers Eulogy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45195";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/obama-delivers-eulogy/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 06:48:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"Alex King: More micro-blogging workflows";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://pinboard-2097310c4ccd2c9bdaac738aaa90b519";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://www.manton.org/2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1170:"<p>Manton writes about a few workflows <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/four-microblogging-community-tips.html">here</a> the follows it up with the post I&#8217;ve linked to.</p>\n<p>FWIW I&#8217;ve posted to my own site first then passed stuff along to Twitter and Facebook since <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2011/08/11/wordpress-social-plugin">we released the Social plugin for WordPress</a> back in 2011.

This was the 3rd, of a now annual, pan-European WordCamp and every year it gets better.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty exciting prospect, as we receive the announcement of next year&#8217;s WordCamp Europe 2016 which will take place in Vienna, Austria, 24-26 June 2016.</p>\n<h3>On larger WordCamps</h3>\n<p>As described on WordCamp Central:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordCamps are informal, community-organized events that are put together by WordPress users like you. Everyone from casual users to core developers participate, share ideas, and get to know each other.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Generally speaking, WordCamps are based around a local community in a specific city. WordCamp Europe is one of two annual WordCamps that span a larger region. The other is WordCamp San Francisco, which is widely considered to be &#8220;the mother ship&#8221;, and will likely evolve into WordCamp US in its next incarnation.</p>\n<p>This new approach of embracing larger WordCamps seems to me to be a sign of a maturing community and project. The content of these WordCamps also seems to reflect this maturation, as topics tend to be less technical and more high level. Covering issues like ethics and cross-community relations.</p>\n<h3>Other regions</h3>\n<p>As individual regions begin to reach similar levels of maturity, the move toward these larger WordCamps is a natural progression. Earlier this year at <a href="https://brisbane.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Brisbane</a> in Australia, there were a number of attendees from the wider Asia Pacific region. The same will be true of <a href="https://kansai.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Kansai</a> in July this year with attendees from outside of Japan travelling to attend and speak.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if, in the not-too-distant-future, we&#8217;ll also see a pan-Asia Pacific WordCamp being organised. Particularly when you look at the size of WordCamps already in places like Tokyo, with attendance approaching 1500 people.</p>\n<h3>Moving forward</h3>\n<p>The European community has set a wonderful example of how a large, roaming, pan-regional WordCamp can and does work. Embraced by the community, and growing every year, with attendance from all over the world.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m very much looking forward to WordCamp Europe 2016 in Vienna, Austria, as we all continue to grow as a community and push WordPress together. Hope to see you there!</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/schmitzoide">Marcel Schmitz</a> for the featured image.</em></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 16:14:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Japh";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: Celebrating 10 Years";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45188";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/celebrating-10-years-of-wordpress-com-automattic-wordpress-com-news/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:146:"<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>We did an <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/?p=31295">official ten year post and video</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 03:58:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: Get WordPress Notifications as a Daily or Weekly Digest";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45667";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wptavern.com/get-wordpress-notifications-as-a-daily-or-weekly-digest";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3512:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/phone.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/phone.jpg?resize=1025%2C473" alt="photo credit: Jan Vašek" class="size-full wp-image-45822" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/7174B21D56">Jan Vašek</a>\n<p>One of the most persistent underlying causes of stress in the digital age is the feeling of drowning in communication. Nearly every Monday on Twitter begins with a litany of complaints from friends about the sheer volume of email that is waiting to be answered. Notifications for all the apps that were supposed to make our lives easier have piled up and the pressure to be &#8220;always on&#8221; suffocates any spark of creative thinking.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep a clean inbox, you have to be very intentional about managing and consolidating as many email notifications as possible. Fortunately for WordPress site owners there&#8217;s a new plugin that will help keep your website from becoming part of the problem.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/swissspidy/" target="_blank">Pascal Birchler</a> and the folks at <a href="http://required.ch/" target="_blank">required+</a> have just released <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/digest/" target="_blank">Digest Notifications</a>, a plugin that aggregates your notifications into one manageable digest. Its settings panel allows you to set the frequency to either daily or weekly at a set time of day. This allows users to limit these notifications to work hours, if so desired.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/digest-settings.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/digest-settings.png?resize=1025%2C317" alt="digest-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45812" /></a></p>\n<p>The digest consolidates the following events into one email:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Core Updates</li>\n<li>New comments that need to be moderated (depending on your settings under &#8216;Settings&#8217; -> &#8216;Discussion&#8217;)</li>\n<li>New user sign-ups</li>\n<li>Password resets by users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what an example digest email might look like:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/digest-email.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/digest-email.png?resize=1025%2C868" alt="digest-email" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45813" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin is also extensible and includes a number of well documented hooks that developers can use to add to the digest queue and modify the email message.</p>\n<p>Depending on how active your site is, the plugin may not make a huge dent in your email load but it can help to keep WordPress from becoming part of your email problem. If you have an active blog with a global readership, then you are likely getting dozens of comment moderation emails throughout the day and night. New user signups can also quickly flood your inbox during times of peak activity.</p>\n<p>Not all notifications are so imperative that you need to receive them by email immediately but you probably don&#8217;t want to turn them off entirely either. This plugin offers you a happy medium. If you&#8217;re struggling to stay afloat in your inbox and WordPress-generated emails are piling up, install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/digest/" target="_blank">Digest Notifications</a> to stay in the loop while keeping emails to a minimum.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 21:54:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WPTavern: Automattic Celebrates 10th Anniversary";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45779";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"http://wptavern.com/automattic-celebrates-10th-anniversary";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3885:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/automattic-offices.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/automattic-offices.jpg?resize=1025%2C478" alt="photo credit: Peter Slutsky" class="size-full wp-image-22370" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://peterslutsky.com/2013/05/14/pics-touring-automattics-new-office/">Peter Slutsky</a>\n<p>Automattic is <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/06/26/celebrating-10-years-of-wordpress-com-automattic/" target="_blank">celebrating its 10th year in business</a> this week. WordPress.com opened its doors in the summer of 2005 and is now closing in on a globally distributed team of 400 employees. Against all odds, CEO Matt Mullenweg, a college dropout with no initial startup funding, built a company that is now valued at $1.2 billion dollars, while successfully maintaining the free, open source WordPress project alongside it.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg took to his <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/06/ten-years-of-automattic/" target="_blank">blog</a> to reminisce about hiring employee #1 in the early days of the company.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you think about it, Donncha was incredibly brave. WordPress had far less than 1% market share. I hadn’t joined Automattic yet — I was still working for CNET, paying Donncha with my salary, savings, and credit cards. He was leaving a Real Job for a Barely a Job; I hardly knew how to wire money to an international account to pay him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fast forward ten years and Automattic has grown to become the most successful WordPress-based business on the books, without compromising its open source principles or users&#8217; freedoms.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It also seemed like the decks were stacked against us. We were going to try and build an open source business model different from what we had seen before, a hybrid of a downloadable open source project combined with a web service that ran the exact same software. Up to that point companies built on open source projects had usually suffocated the communities that spawned them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The open source community continues to thrive, thanks in part to the many contributions from Automattic.</p>\n<p>With <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-look-back-at-16-automattic-acquisitions-since-2007" target="_blank">17 acquisitions</a> under its belt, including the recent WooCommerce deal, Automattic has judiciously added to its numbers and expanded its horizons to include a number of non-WordPress technologies. Mullenweg strives to <a href="http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-on-ensuring-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">maintain a spirit of experimentation</a> at the company, rather than simply focusing on their successful products.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com was recently recognized in the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015" target="_blank">Who Has Your Back</a></em> report, for achieving a <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/a-perfect-eff-score-were-proud-to-have-your-back/" target="_blank">perfect score</a> in protecting users&#8217; rights against government requests. The company&#8217;s unwavering commitment to push back against unlawful censorship is one of the things that sets it apart from others and helps to further democratize publishing across the globe.</p>\n<p>As of 2015, WordPress.com stats show 137 languages have been used to publish more than 2.5 billion posts. Automattic is digging in its heels, as WordPress&#8217; global marketshare continues to grow beyond 24%. For Mullenweg, these past 10 years are just the beginning:</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re building something that gives people all over the world a voice and that people can trust to be thriving a century from now, and that’s huge.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 19:35:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"WPTavern: Matt Mullenweg Appoints Nikolay Bachiyski as Security Czar for the WordPress Project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45777";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-appoints-nikolay-bachiyski-as-security-czar-for-the-wordpress-project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2635:"<p>While on stage at <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Europe</a> answering a question related to WordPress&#8217; security track record, Matt Mullenweg named <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/nbachiyski">Nikolay Bachiyski</a> as the first Security Czar for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress project</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcement by <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt">@photomatt</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wceu?src=hash">#wceu</a>: Nikolay Bachiyski (<a href="https://twitter.com/nikolayb">@nikolayb</a>) is new Security Czar for <a href="http://t.co/ALFwuNTcoy">http://t.co/ALFwuNTcoy</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; DeborahEdwards-Onoro (@redcrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/redcrew/status/614414379380011009">June 26, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bachiyski is employed by Automattic and has been a member of the WordPress community for more than 10 years. Over that time period, he&#8217;s established trust with a number of people in and outside of the WordPress ecosystem. The role allows Bachiyski to focus on communication and triage security reports.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg admitted on stage that there have been communication issues in the past. He didn&#8217;t specify any examples, but one that comes to mind is <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">WordPress 4.2.1</a>.</p>\n<p>In April 2015, security researcher <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>, published details of a security vulnerability in WordPress hours before the team released a patch. He tried contacting the WordPress security team using a variety of channels, all of which came up empty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress has refused all communication attempts about our ongoing security vulnerability cases since November 2014. We have tried to reach them by email, via the national authority (CERT-FI), and via <a href="http://hackerone.com" target="_blank">HackerOne</a>. No answer of any kind has been received since November 20, 2014.</p>\n<p>According to our knowledge, their security response team have also refused to respond to the Finnish communications regulatory authority who has tried to coordinate resolving the issues we have reported, and to staff of HackerOne, which has tried to clarify the status our open bug tickets.</p></blockquote>\n<p>No one from the WordPress security team officially announced why or how the breakdown in communication occurred. Hopefully, with Bachiyski as Security Czar for the WordPress project, breakdowns in communication like these decrease or disappear entirely.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 18:04:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: Help Improve bbPress by Taking the 2015 User Survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45697";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://wptavern.com/help-improve-bbpress-by-taking-the-2015-user-survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1771:"<p>If you use bbPress, it&#8217;s time to voice your opinions and let the development team know what you think by taking the <a href="https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/05/2015-bbpress-survey/">2015 bbPress user survey</a>.

A successful campaign funded by passionate supporters can make an idea into reality or bring fresh momentum for another round of development.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bi0xid/kayosey-the-first-100-accessible-theme-for-wordpre" target="_blank">Kayosey</a> is the latest community project seeking funding for a good cause &#8211; the creation of the first 100% accessible theme for WordPress. The four-person team behind the Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bi0xid/kayosey-the-first-100-accessible-theme-for-wordpre" target="_blank">campaign</a> is led by WordPress developer <a href="http://raven.es/" target="_blank">Rafa Poveda</a>, an organizer for WordCamp Sevilla and WordCamp Europe 2015. They aim to raise $6,770 to fund the development of the first AAA, fully-accessible and fully-responsive theme/framework for WordPress.</p>\n<p>If successfully funded, Kayosey will be released as a free theme, 100% GPL v2 or later, and will be submitted to the official WordPress Theme Directory for anyone to use. The theme&#8217;s creators believe that it has the potential to make a major impact on the overall accessibility of the web. Poveda summarized the goal for the campaign:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our goal is to create the first fully accessible, upgradeable and adaptable to all devices theme for WordPress. Today, <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">24% of the web works with WordPress</a>, being the most used CMS by developers. <strong>An accessible parent theme for WordPress will virtually make 1/4 of the web accessible.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Although the existence of the an accessible parent theme is not likely to translate directly into 1/4 of the web becoming more accessible, it would provide a solid starting place for developers who are interested in producing accessible themes. The vast majority of WordPress themes <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-suck-at-accessibility-its-time-to-fix-it" target="_blank">lag in meeting accessibility guidelines</a> and the official directory doesn&#8217;t have much of a selection listed under the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/" target="_blank">accessibility-ready</a> tag.</p>\n<p>Poveda and his team plan to work closely with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/" target="_blank">WordPress&#8217; Accessibility Team</a> and will propose changes to core as necessary to help make WordPress 100% accessible. They will be using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">WAI</a> (The Web Access Initiative) as a reference manual. The project will be documented publicly on GitLab and GitHub to keep supporters up to date.</p>\n<p>The Kayosey team outlined a few stretch goals beyond the € 6,000 they are hoping to raise, which would enable the team to expand the parent theme into a framework and eventually add WooCommerce compatibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>€ 6,000 &#8211; GOAL! We will make a 100%-a11y WordPress parent theme!</li>\n<li>€ 12,000 &#8211; More than a theme &#8211; We will create Kayosey Framework, the first accessible framework, full of options to make the development easier.</li>\n<li>€ 20,000 &#8211; WooCommerce compatibility! Everyone should be able to make a shop with WordPress without external help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far, the Kayosey project has reached 12% of the $6,770 goal. The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bi0xid/kayosey-the-first-100-accessible-theme-for-wordpre/description" target="_blank">campaign</a> has one month remaining before the fundraising deadline.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 20:27:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Post Status: Growth in the French community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=13527";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://poststatus.com/growth-in-the-french-community/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9310:"<p>After the first WordCamp in France in 2008, organizer <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/xibe">Xavier Borderie</a>, co-founder of the WordPress Francophone Association and one of the principal contributors to the French translation of WordPress, <a href="http://www.wordpress-fr.net/2008/05/04/wordcamp-paris-merci-a-tous/">wrote</a>, &#8220;We&#8217;re calling it &#8216;WordCamp Paris&#8217; and not &#8216;WordCamp France&#8217; because we&#8217;re not so blind as to think that Paris is the only city that counts. I can&#8217;t wait to see people launch WordCamps in their own cities!&#8221;</p>\n<p>It would take six years for that to happen, but in the last eight months, three new WordPress events have popped up in different cities in France, including one official WordCamp and two independent conferences.</p>\n<p>The first one on the scene was <a href="http://2014.wptech.fr">WP Tech Nantes</a>, a one-day, one-track event held in late November 2014, focused on development. They had 140 attendees for their first year and aim to double attendance in 2015. Although WP Tech draws from the growing WordPress community in Nantes, there are whispers of it going on the road.</p>\n<p>Next up was <a href="https://lyon.wordcamp.org">WordCamp Lyon</a>, now the second official WordCamp in France, which took place June 5th. True to Lyonnais culture, the event was organized on a massive barge, with 230 participants in all. A one-day event with two tracks, it was amazing to see both a high percentage of women among attendees (30% according to organizers) and a real diversity of backgrounds. There were developers, designers, bloggers, marketing folk, and even a local Drupal community leader came out to join us and compare notes.</p>\n<p>The following day, in the sunny coastal town of Biarritz in France&#8217;s Basque region, was <a href="http://2015.wpmx.org">WPMX Day</a>. The name comes from the local Meetup group and association, <a href="http://wpmx.org">WordPress Meet and Exchange</a>, founded in 2013. The close proximity to the Lyon event was a shame, but there was still a nice turnout with 110 attendees, and top-notch speakers such as <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/corsonr/">Remi Corson</a> (WooThemes, now Automattic), and <a href="https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie">Stephanie Walter</a>, known outside the WordPress community for her work in web and mobile UI.</p>\n<p>Organizers of these new events have plans to continue the tradition, giving France a total of four annual WordPress conferences. There has also been talk of starting up more topic-focused events like WP Tech, so we may soon see a French Pressnomics among others.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zfqVcMIxLnbM.kwj1b1s4cURI&usp=sharing"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13528" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/map-france-752x376.jpg" alt="France WordPress Map" width="752" height="376" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on and off with WordPress since 2007, and full time since 2011, but it wasn&#8217;t until January of 2013 that I visited my first WordCamp. The experience literally changed my life. A hardened freelancer, it gave me a taste of what it was to get out there, to share, and exchange with people about a subject that we were all passionate about. It gave me a glimpse of what was really going on around me: not only was I far from alone, but the French community was also thriving and producing a mass of interesting, exciting work.</p>\n<h3>Spotlight on France</h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.mailpoet.com">MailPoet</a> is a distributed company based in France, with a total of <a href="http://www.mailpoet.com/about-the-wysija-team-members/">13 people in 8 countries</a>. When I met co-founder <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kgjerstad/">Kim Gjerstad</a>, a French Canadian who lives in Aix-en-Provence, at my first WordCamp in Paris, I began to get an idea of what the WordPress economy was like beyond the world of building themes. Kim spoke at WordCamp Europe in Leiden later that year about the <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/25/kim-gjerstad-is-the-freemium-model-right-for-your-plugin/">freemium business model</a>. Today MailPoet boasts over 3,686,635 downloads and continues to <a href="http://www.mailpoet.com/jobs/">hire new staff</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wp-rocket.me">WP Rocket</a> impressed me when, in February of this year, and following the lead of companies such as Buffer, Baremetrics, and Mattermark, they declared their <a href="http://blog.wp-rocket.me/transparency-matters/">pledge to total transparency</a> by publishing numbers on their revenue and client base. With an update and <a href="http://blog.wp-rocket.me/inside-wp-rocket-april-2015/">new data published in May</a>, this looks like it will be a quarterly tradition, one that I hope will inspire others as the taboo to share such information is very strong in France. Lead developer <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/juliobox">Julio Potier</a> runs his own WordPress security consultancy, is a regular speaker at WordCamps and other web conferences in France and abroad, and is also a core contributor. <a href="https://twitter.com/jb_ma">Jean-Baptiste Marchand-Arvier</a> &amp; <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/geekpress/">Jonathan Buttigieg</a> are also prominent community members and half of the force behind WordCamp Lyon.</p>\n<p>Another one of our local heroes is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/imath">Mathieu Viet</a>, also known as imath. By day, Mathieu works as a programmer for La Poste. By night, he is one of the BuddyPress core developers. He is also co-organizer of the Paris Meetup group, and co-founder of <a href="http://veryfrenchtrip.com">Very French Trip</a>, which started as a small group who travelled to Leiden together for the first WordCamp Europe, and has since turned into a successful podcast. The other leaders of this group are <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aglekis/">Grégoire Noyelle</a>, our resident Genesis specialist, and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/thierrypigot">Thierry Pigot</a>, who recently signed on as CEO of <a href="http://www.whodunit.fr">Whodunit</a>, one of the largest WordPress agencies in Paris (they are both also on the organizing team for WordCamp Paris).</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ozh">Ozh Richard</a>, who is probably best known as co-author of <em>Professional WordPress Plugin Development</em> and creator of YOURLS, hails from Nantes. He attended WP Tech Nantes where he signed quite a few autographs, and gave his first ever talk at WordCamp Paris in January. It was quite the honor!</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/">Polylang</a> is quickly becoming the preferred solution among many for creating multilingual sites with WordPress, the other two major contenders being WPML and Multilingual Press. We knew its creator was French, but it took the community a while to put a real name on the elusive <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/chouby/">Chouby</a>. Frédéric Demarle made his public debut at WordCamp Lyon and was immediately embraced and revered by all.</p>\n<p>France also proudly counts a number of core contributors among its ranks, including: Amaury Balmer, Xavier Borderie, Alex Concha, Frederic Demarle, Nicolas Juen, Kevin Legrand, Michel (xiligroup), Lionel Pointet, Julio Potier, Fabien Quatravaux, Ozh Richard, &amp; Grégory Viguier to name a few I was able to identify.</p>\n<h3>Acting locally, thinking globally</h3>\n<p>WordPress, this simple piece of software that so many of us have built our businesses on — built a big part of our lives around — is a global community. It brings people together from all parts of the globe to share knowledge, promote a common philosophy, and develop a self-sustaining economy.</p>\n<p>In the same way we talk about promoting WordPress from the ground floor up, so too do local communities play an essential role in this greater ecosystem. WordCamps are both proof and reminders of that, and the growth seen in local communities in France has been tremendous this past year. Success stories from the other side of the world can be inspiring, but success stories from your own backyard are tangible.</p>\n<p>Only in local communities can we tackle problems that are specific to our cultures, to our laws and to our specific needs. Working together at this ground level creates momentum, and I believe that’s what we’re seeing here in France. WordPress is viable; an open-source economy is viable. The open exchange of ideas, the very principal of community that WordPress is built on, creates an environment in which we all can thrive, both financially and as human beings.</p>\n<p>The only foreseeable danger I see in local communities is losing sight of the global picture — of where we came from. All roads must lead back to WordPress. It’s not a perfect road; there are bumps to navigate and bridges to be built. I believe that strong, united local communities can make a global impact, helping to pave those roads and create a better experience for all. I also believe that the global recognition of these local communities can go a long way toward encouraging continued growth. The road goes both ways.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 02:09:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Jenny";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 196 – Interview with Joshua Millage and Mark Nelson of LifterLMS";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=45654&preview_id=45654";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-196-interview-with-joshua-millage-and-mark-nelson-of-lifterlms";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1871:"<p>In this week&#8217;s episode, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I are joined by Joshua Millage, host of the <a href="http://infusioncast.co/">Infusioncast</a> and <a href="http://lmscast.com/">LMScast</a> podcasts and Mark Nelson, lead developer of <a href="https://www.codebox.io/">codeBOX</a> and <a href="https://lifterlms.com/">LifterLMS</a>.</p>\n<p>In the first half of the show, Millage explains the versatility and power of <a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com/">Infusionsoft,</a> especially when it&#8217;s integrated with WordPress.

The theme is centered around showcasing the work of visual artists such as designers, photographers, craft makers, painters, etc., with portfolio items featured prominently on the homepage template.</p>\n<p>Argent was designed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/melchoyce" target="_blank">Mel Choyce</a>, co-author of the popular <a href="http://wptavern.com/flounder-a-free-wordpress-theme-with-colorful-post-formats" target="_blank">Flounder</a> and <a href="http://wptavern.com/aventurine-a-free-wordpress-theme-featuring-bold-typography-and-bright-colors" target="_blank">Aventurine</a> themes. Her designs are generally very focused and Argent is no exception. While the theme is well-suited to a wide range of creative professionals, it wasn&#8217;t designed to be an agency/business/blogging theme all in one. Argent is clearly a portfolio theme right out of the gate.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/argent-screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/argent-screenshot.jpg?resize=621%2C761" alt="argent-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45568" /></a></p>\n<p>Artists won&#8217;t need to fight with this theme to simplify it down to something that&#8217;s easy to personalize. The theme&#8217;s customizer options allow you to display 3, 6, or 9 portfolio projects on the homepage template. It also includes controls for changing the header and background images and text colors.</p>\n<p>All of the content on posts and pages is centered. There is no sidebar, but Argent includes support for three footer widget areas.</p>\n<p>When used on a self-hosted WordPress site in combination with Jetpack and its Custom Content Types module, you can add portfolio projects. Each portfolio item includes support for a full-width image carousel. This is automatically generated from the first gallery included in the portfolio post.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/argent-portfolio-gallery.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/argent-portfolio-gallery.png?resize=621%2C698" alt="argent-portfolio-gallery" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45577" /></a></p>\n<p>One thing to appreciate about the blog section is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about having excessively large, oddly-shaped featured images to make it look like the demo. Argent&#8217;s blog archives template is simple with short, one-sentence excerpts and small rectangular featured images.</p>\n<p>Typography is never an afterthought in Choyce&#8217;s designs, and Argent places a strong emphasis on <a href="https://argentdemo.wordpress.com/readability/" target="_blank">readability</a>. The theme features the contrasting &#8220;Alegreya&#8221; font for headers and quotes and &#8220;Cabin&#8221; for paragraph text. It also includes styling for right and left pullquotes to emphasize text.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on the hunt for a new portfolio theme, check out a <a href="https://argentdemo.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of Argent. Given the small number of design options to configure, artists will have an easy time getting their works online.</p>\n<p>The theme hasn&#8217;t yet hit WordPress.org but should land there soon. In the meantime, self-hosted WordPress blog owners can <a href="https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/argent/" target="_blank">download it</a> from the sidebar of the theme&#8217;s description page on WordPress.com.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 05:59:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: New Plugin Removes All Traces of the Customizer in WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45435";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-removes-all-traces-of-the-customizer-in-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6406:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/erase.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/erase.jpg?resize=1024%2C511" alt="photo credit: #2 Pencils - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-45564" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/97651299@N00/13522861733">#2 Pencils</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>Anti-customizer vitriol reached its zenith last week when the Menu Customizer plugin was officially <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-officially-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">approved for merge into WordPress 4.3</a>. Opponents of the feature voiced concerns about the readiness of the UI for all screen sizes, particularly for the desktop where many find the experience of managing menus to be crammed into an unnecessarily narrow space.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the feature plugin&#8217;s author <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-tentatively-approved-for-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">attributed</a> the broader community&#8217;s ongoing Customizer resistance to &#8220;more of an educational issue,&#8221; WordPress core contributors published <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/" target="_blank">a post reaffirming their commitment to advancing the customizer</a>. It states that the purpose behind the live preview framework is to build user trust by providing a safe way to make non-destructive changes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are committed to providing live preview for all aspects of site customization and making it usable on all devices from phones to large screens,&#8221; Boren said in the post.</p>\n<p>The admin menus screen will continue to be supported for the time being, but the long-term plan is to eliminate them in future versions of WordPress in favor of the customizer interface.</p>\n<h3>A Plugin to Unhook the Customizer</h3>\n<p>The new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-remove-all-parts/" target="_blank">Customizer Remove All Parts</a> plugin, hosted on GitHub under the acronym &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/parallelus/wp-crap" target="_blank">WP-CRAP</a>,&#8221; was written in response to the decision to bring menus in the customizer. WordPress developers Jesse Petersen and Andy Wilkerson <a href="http://www.petersenmediagroup.com/wordpress-tips/a-response-to-the-wordpress-customizer-expansion-removal/" target="_blank">joined forces to create a plugin</a> that would unhook the Customizer from every aspect of WordPress site management.</p>\n<p>Once installed, it removes all customizer links from the Appearance menu, Themes screen, and the admin toolbar, essentially rolling your site back to the days prior to WordPress 3.4 when the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API" target="_blank">Theme Customization API</a> was introduced. I tested it and found that it works exactly as advertised.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/customizer-links.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/customizer-links.jpg?resize=772%2C250" alt="customizer-links" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45553" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Anything that was having its link hijacked to go to the Customizer has had that filter removed,&#8221; Petersen said. &#8220;This is the nuclear option, as there are no settings whatsoever. Use it if you don’t want your clients or team to have any access to or knowledge of the Customizer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Petersen and Wilkerson <a href="http://www.petersenmediagroup.com/wordpress-tips/a-response-to-the-wordpress-customizer-expansion-removal/" target="_blank">contend that menus are handled as content</a> in the WordPress database and therefore do not require the same treatment as other design aspects of the site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Menus aren’t design,&#8221; Petersen said. &#8220;They are content. Look in the database, menus are found in the posts tables. As such, they aren’t subject to the same design edits as other items in Customizer, such as the background or custom header image/logo. For those items, I 100% support a Customizer or similar interface to preview changes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This argument may not bear as much weight when WordPress finally gets frontend content editing capabilities in core &#8211; a feature which <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/" target="_blank">Boren&#8217;s post</a> identified as possibly integrating with the customizer.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Petersen and Wilkerson want the option to turn the customizer off in the dashboard, but WordPress&#8217; &#8220;Decisions, not Options&#8221; <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/" target="_blank">philosophy</a> prevents that from being a viable possibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are currently in development of a fork that allows you to selectively remove everything based on user role and more detailed settings,&#8221; Petersen said. &#8220;This is how we feel Customizer should work in core. There should be some way to turn it off in the dashboard, no different than your ability to turn off the admin toolbar. Maybe this will get rolled into core in 4.5.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress, in its vanilla state, is not perfect for all scenarios, but this is why the plugin system exists. It allows anyone to make WordPress their own, offering alternatives for those who disagree with the direction of core development. The WP-CRAP plugin is a perfect example of utilizing the plugin system to have WordPress your way.</p>\n<p>Based on the &#8220;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/" target="_blank">Trust, Live Preview, and Menus in the Customizer</a>&#8221; core manifesto, WordPress users can expect that future releases will further the customizer agenda into every aspect of site customization. If you feel that the customizer has over extended its reach and planted its hooks into too many areas of WordPress, the WP-CRAP plugin offers you the option to turn it all off.  Download it from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-remove-all-parts/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a> or via its home on <a href="https://github.com/parallelus/wp-crap" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 00:01:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: Good Environment Reads";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45181";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/earth-reads/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:889:"<p>In light of the Pope&#8217;s encyclical last week and the US election season ramping up, there has been some great writing on the environment lately.

Negotiations failed and on June 18th, 2015, the Foundation filed the lawsuit.</p>\n<h2>Lawyers Battle it Out</h2>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">United States Trademark and Patent Office</a> is a public website where visitors can discover and file for patents and trademarks. On <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86448439&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=documentSearch">November 7th, 2014</a>, the WordPress Foundation <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86448439&docId=APP20141111074846#docIndex=7&page=1">submitted an application</a> to register the WordPress character mark which consists of standard characters, without claim to any particular font, style, size, or color.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressMark.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-45533" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressMark.png?resize=660%2C127" alt="WordPress Standard Character Mark" /></a>WordPress Standard Character Mark\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of where the mark is already in use.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressMarkinAction.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-45534" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressMarkinAction.png?resize=649%2C239" alt="WordPress Mark in Use" /></a>WordPress Mark in Use\n<p>Once applications are published to the <a href="https://tmog.uspto.gov/#issueDate=2015-04-14&serialNumber=86448439"><span class="normal">Trademark Official Gazette</span></a>, parties who <span class="normal">believe it will be damaged by the registration of the mark may file a notice of opposition with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. If no party files an opposition or extension request within 30 days after the publication date, then a certificate of registration will be issued eleven weeks after the publication date.</span></p>\n<p>On May 5th, 2015, Yablon filed an <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=1">opposition request </a>stating that if the Foundation successfully registers the mark, his company and others would be gravely and adversely effected. The Foundation&#8217;s lawyers responded on June 19th, 2015, by asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=4">suspend the registration process</a> until the civil lawsuit in the District Court has completed.</p>\n<p>On June 21st, 2015, Yablon <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=7">filed a motion</a> requesting default judgement and objected to the Foundation&#8217;s request to suspend the preceding. The case has yet to play out in court but lawyers from both parties are  battling it out in the public sphere.</p>\n<h2>A Conversation with Yablon</h2>\n<p>I spoke with Yablon on the phone for over an hour to figure out why he&#8217;s put himself in this position. During our conversation, I determined that he&#8217;s intelligent and has a good understanding of trademark law. He believes the WordPress Helpers website furthers the WordPress project by being an informational resource.</p>\n<p>Using WordPress in his domain name is a business decision that allows people to instantly know what his site is about. He genuinely cares about the WordPress project, its community, and respects the Foundation&#8217;s rights to protect its trademarks.</p>\n<p>He also told me that he&#8217;s not out to make a buck or prove a point. He&#8217;s defending his business from an entity that has a domain policy, not a law.

Neither did I, honestly. And it’s been amazing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ll remember the days before I knew everything.<br />\n&#8212; The Automattic Creed</p></blockquote>\n<p>When you think about it, Donncha was incredibly brave. <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> had far less than 1% market share. I hadn’t joined <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> yet &#8212; I was still working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET">CNET</a>, paying Donncha with my salary, savings, and credit cards. He was leaving a Real Job for a Barely a Job; I hardly knew how to wire money to an international account to pay him. I’d just made <a href="http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/">a giant screw-up</a> (probably my biggest ever), taking money to have spam advertising on WordPress.org, so I wasn’t the most confidence-inspiring leader.</p>\n<p>It also seemed like the decks were stacked against us. We were going to try and build an open source business model different from what we had seen before, a hybrid of a downloadable open source project combined with a web service that ran the exact same software. Up to that point companies built on open source projects had usually suffocated the communities that spawned them.</p>\n<p>Sign me up, right? But we had one important thing going for us: at our cores, we shared a deep belief that open source could transform any industry it touched and that web publishing needed to be democratized. We’d been hackers-in-arms together coding on WordPress, and knew we could take that and build on it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation.<br />\n&#8211; The Automattic Creed</p></blockquote>\n<p>Within that first year we were joined by <a href="https://andy.wordpress.com/">Andy</a>, <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan</a>, <a href="http://toni.org/">Toni</a>, and <a href="http://romanticrobot.net/">Mark</a>, and together we began building a business which looks remarkably similar to what Automattic does today. (We&#8217;re all still at Automattic, by the way.)</p>\n<p>We just want to make the web a better place. We&#8217;re proud to contribute to what I consider the best open source project in the world, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. We bring it to as wide an audience as possible through hosting it on <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, and providing services for the ones we don&#8217;t host with tools like <a href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack</a>. Through it all, we have fun and experiment with side projects that have become crucial to the ways we work &#8212; <a href="http://p2theme.com/">P2</a>, <a href="http://cloudup.com/">Cloudup</a>, <a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a>, and dozens more that we tried, failed, learned something from, and tried again.</p>\n<p>Our work is far from finished, and I hope there are hundreds of failures we learn from over the next 20 years. One of the things that makes me happiest is that I get to wake up every morning and work on the hard problem of making the web a better and more open place, and I do it alongside close to <a href="http://automattic.com/about/">400 talented people at Automattic</a> and thousands in the broader community. For me this is a life&#8217;s work. The first decade is merely the first chapter of what I hope to be a very long book, which will eventually tell the story of a movement and a company that are at the core of this crazy thing we call &#8220;the web.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.<br />\n&#8212; The Automattic Creed</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some find it strange that someone in this day and age would have the same job for a decade. The truth is, it&#8217;s not the same job: it’s always evolving. At times it&#8217;s been comfortable, at times it&#8217;s been extraordinarily challenging. I&#8217;ve needed to change how I work. Automattic has changed. The structure of the company is designed to accommodate growth, and we’re constantly experimenting with how we work and relate to one another.</p>\n<p>Half the time I feel like we&#8217;re making it up as we go along &#8212; I&#8217;ve never managed a distributed company of 400 people before. But the important things stay the same: the desire for impact and my love for the people I work with. They embody the Automattic creed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you, Donncha, for believing in me all those years ago and pioneering the way for a company that would come to impact a lot of the world. Thank you Andy, Ryan, Toni, and Mark. Thank you to every Automattician that’s made the same leap. We’re building something that gives people all over the world a voice and that people can trust to be thriving a century from now, and that’s huge.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot more to do, and I can’t wait to see what a “20 Years of Automattic” post says.

This is especially true for sites with a more complex and varied user base.</p>\n<p>By default, BuddyPress displays all profile field groups to all users, whether they are applicable or not. The new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-conditional-field-groups/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Conditional Field Groups</a> plugin is one way to address this problem and provide more flexibility for administrators in field group creation.</p>\n<p>The plugin, created by WordPress developer <a href="http://tannermoushey.com/" target="_blank">Tanner Moushey</a>, allows administrators to hide a field group based on <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities" target="_blank">user roles</a>. This makes it possible to collect and display different sets of information based on selections assigned in the plugin&#8217;s settings panel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/buddypress-conditional-field-groups-settings.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/buddypress-conditional-field-groups-settings.png?resize=982%2C550" alt="buddypress-conditional-field-groups-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45497" /></a></p>\n<p>As all field groups default to visible to all users, the field groups that are checked in the settings will not be shown for the corresponding user role on the front end. For example, for users with author or contributor roles, the site can feature additional profile fields related to their specific roles in the community while hiding that field group for all other roles. Here&#8217;s a quick demo:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bp-conditional-profile-field-groups-demo.gif"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bp-conditional-profile-field-groups-demo.gif?resize=480%2C360" alt="bp-conditional-profile-field-groups-demo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45504" /></a></p>\n<p>Combine it with the <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-conditional-profile-fields-to-buddypress" target="_blank">Conditional Profile Fields</a> plugin and you have a great deal of flexibility.</p>\n<p>Of course, this plugin only applies on sites where members have been neatly divided into user roles by an administrator. Since these roles are generally assigned based on publishing capabilities, this plugin is likely useful for sites that are running an active blog.</p>\n<p>If Moushey were to further extend BuddyPress Conditional Field Groups plugin, it would be useful to be able to hide field groups based on member type, as defined by any plugin utilizing the new <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-on-track-to-provide-a-basic-member-type-api" target="_blank">Member Type API</a> added in <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-spumoni-released-featuring-new-member-type-api" target="_blank">BuddyPress 2.2</a>. This would greatly expand the usefulness of the plugin for more communities.</p>\n<p>The plugin in its current form is a valuable tool for BuddyPress-powered communities that rely heavily on WordPress user roles to define capabilities for a diverse user base. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-conditional-field-groups/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Conditional Field Groups</a> is available for free on WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 02:24:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: Theme Juice: A New Auto Site Generator for WordPress Development with Vagrant";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45438";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"http://wptavern.com/theme-juice-a-new-vagrant-configuration-for-wordpress-development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7671:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/juice.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/juice.jpg?resize=1025%2C508" alt="photo credit: Roma" class="size-full wp-image-45470" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/6OJ88579KG">Roma</a>\n<p>As WordPress developers everywhere are adopting Vagrant for local development, new configurations seem to pop up every week to address the needs of different teams and workflows. <a href="http://themejuice.it/" target="_blank">Theme Juice</a> is the newest open source project to join the ever-growing list of <a href="http://wptavern.com/13-vagrant-resources-for-wordpress-development" target="_blank">WordPress-related Vagrant resources</a>.</p>\n<p>The project is based on <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">VVV</a>, one of the most popular and best-supported Vagrant configurations. Its VM is built on an Apache fork of VVV called <a href="https://github.com/ericmann/vvv-apache" target="_blank">VVV-Apache</a>.</p>\n<p>Theme Juice installs as a Ruby gem and requires requires <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>. The <code>tj create</code> command leads you through prompts to set up project information, location, database info and will then create a local development environment (if one isn&#8217;t already in place.) It automatically syncs the local project location with the project location within the VM, enabling it to be run from anywhere on your system.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif?resize=640%2C379" alt="ezgif.com-optimize (2)" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45464" /></a></p>\n<p>It also <a href="https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-cli#is-windows-supported" target="_blank">supports Windows</a> with a few feature limitations.</p>\n<p>If you are not using Apache, Theme Juice can be modified for use with Nginx via the original VVV, which is as easy as running it with a few flags:</p>\n<p><code>tj new --vm-box git@github.com:Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git --nginx</code></p>\n<h4>Access Projects from Other Devices, Including Mobile</h4>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/xip-.io_.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/xip-.io_.jpg?resize=640%2C230" alt="xip-.io" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45462" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the unique features of Theme Juice is that every project created with <code>tj</code> is automatically set to support <a href="http://xip.io/" target="_blank">xip.io</a>, a free magic domain name that provides wildcard DNS for any IP address. This enables access to virtual hosts on your development server from other devices on your local network, ie. tablets and phones. This works best with OSX, according to TJ&#8217;s documentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re using OSX, then everything should work out of the box. If you&#8217;re not using OSX, then you&#8217;ll need to point port 80 on your host machine to 8080; Vagrant cannot do this by default for security reasons.</p>\n<p>Once everything is good to go, you can access a project from another device on the same network by going to:<br />\n< project-name >.< your-hosts-ip-address >.xip.io </p>\n<p>e.g. themejuice.192.168.1.1.xip.io.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This feature allows you to easily test your development projects on mobile devices with no extra configuration required.</p>\n<h3>The Origins of Theme Juice</h3>\n<p>The project was created by <a href="http://ezekielg.com/" target="_blank">Ezekiel Gabrielse</a> and the folks at <a href="http://produceresults.com/" target="_blank">Produce Results</a> for internal use at their agency. Gabrielse is the lead developer for a small team of developers for whom Theme Juice is now an indispensable tool.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We work at a fast pace, so having the ability to create and remove development projects easily, a well as quickly restore/set up existing projects, is essential to keeping our flow, well, flowing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been dogfooding and developing this utility for almost 10 months and are excited to finally get it out to the community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gabrielse built Theme Juice to ease the process of creating new development sites, which he found to be somewhat inconvenient with VVV.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a few weeks of using vanilla VVV, I quickly realized that the process of creating a new site was very repetitive, and like any developer, I sought to automate that repetition,&#8221; he said. (This was long before <a href="http://wptavern.com/variable-vvv-a-new-vvv-site-creation-wizard-for-wordpress" target="_blank">Variable VVV</a> was released, which automates site creation and deletion.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;What started as a quick little (actually, it got pretty large) Rake task included in our company starter theme, quickly grew into a separate project that I extracted out to a Ruby gem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The resulting Theme Juice project integrates with VVV and leverages many of its unique features but adds auto site setup and additional functionality to manage build tools for Gabrielse&#8217;s development team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Suffice it to say, it saves us time by automating the entire process of creating new development projects,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We also incorporated a sort of crude scripting via a configuration file (called a Juicefile) that allows us to easily run any build processes we need to upon project creation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once Gabrielse realized how useful that functionality was, he pushed it out further and abstracted all of the team&#8217;s build tools to the configuration. This enabled them to seamlessly switch between tools whenever a project required it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve recently changed from Guard to Grunt, from NPM packages to Bower packages,&#8221; Gabrielse said. &#8220;Having all of those tools abstracted out to <code>tj</code> commands, we didn&#8217;t have to change anything in our workflow, our build scripts, our deployments, etc., because everything was already using the command aliases provided by <code>tj</code>. This also allows us to transition from project to project without having to worry about how to run the build tools for that particular project, as it&#8217;s all abstracted out, so that we can focus on the task at hand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Theme Juice caters towards experienced developers who like to use modern build tools and systems for their development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using our starter theme, we use Composer for PHP/WP plugin management, Bower for front-end dependencies, Grunt for managing build tools, which includes Coffee, Haml, and Sass compilation,&#8221; Gabrielse said. &#8220;At first glance this seems daunting to have to manage all of that, but with using <code>tj</code>, it&#8217;s easy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A list of all the global options and commands is available on the <a href="http://themejuice.it/" target="_blank">Theme Juice documentation page</a>.</p>\n<p>In the future, Gabrielse plans to extend Theme Juice to handle deployments.

WordPress powers over 35% of the web now. The REST API has been in WordPress core for a few years; the year after the REST API was merged into core, WordPress gained nearly 5% marketshare.</p>\n<p>Almost all WordPress sites use the REST API in some form or another, and an estimated 15% of all native apps use WordPress purely as a backend. 80% of the top 100 news websites run WordPress with front-ends powered by the REST API. A dozen popular hosted website platforms have custom admins or front-end editors that use the API.</p>\n<p>All of the &#8220;we should get to this eventually&#8221; items have actually been done, unbelievably, and we&#8217;ve entered the Golden Age of the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>Many people all across the web are using the API. Here are some of their stories.</p>\n<h3>Jack, A YouTube User</h3>\n<p>Meet Jack. He&#8217;s an avid follower of various different YouTube channels, some of which are 15 years old now. YouTube is still one of the biggest media companies, especially since the number of hamsterkitten videos has skyrocketed since the animal was first crossbred in 2018. Jack runs a fan site that has a few thousand hits a day, which is not a huge site, but roughly in the middle of the long-tail of WordPress sites. He hopes to grow it further though.</p>\n<p>Jack&#8217;s just seen a great new video pop up on the new video feed. After having watched it (and taken extensive notes), he decides to share it with his followers on his WordPress site. Underneath the video, he taps on the &#8220;Share on WordPress&#8221; link.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13470" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/api-sharetowp-752x233.png" alt="api-sharetowp" width="752" height="233" /> Due to the decentralized nature of WordPress sites, YouTube can&#8217;t register with Jack&#8217;s site directly without a lot of effort. Instead, YouTube has registered with WordPress.org as a client beforehand (just like a normal centralized service). WordPress.org acts as a middleman between centralized services and clients, and the millions of WordPress installs out there on the &#8216;net.</p>\n<p>YouTube sends Jack off to WordPress.org to create a post. WordPress.org checks and finds that YouTube is a registered client, and they haven&#8217;t been blacklisted or had their tokens revoked.  Usually, WordPress.org would ask Jack to enter his site, but Jack&#8217;s done this before, so his browser has remembered the sites he&#8217;s entered previously. He picks his site from the list (hamsterkitten.com).</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13471" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/api-connectto-752x351.png" alt="api-connectto" width="752" height="351" /></p>\n<p>In the background, WordPress.org asks hamsterkitten.com to issue credentials for YouTube, and tells them how to talk to each other directly. (These are OAuth 1.0a credentials, sent over insecure HTTP, since Jack hasn&#8217;t gotten around to setting up his free SSL certificate yet. One of these days&#8230;)</p>\n<p>hamsterkitten.com checks and finds that Jack has already done this before, so YouTube already has a set of credentials ready to go. He&#8217;s also already approved linking his YouTube account to his user account on his site, so he doesn&#8217;t need to approve his account manually. It passes the credentials back to YouTube, and YouTube sends a request back with the video data.</p>\n<p>Jack doesn&#8217;t see any of these happening in the background. His browser sends him off to hamsterkitten.com&#8217;s WordPress admin, where the video is pre-entered into his editor. He adds some witty comments and publishes the post. YouTube then automatically shares the video on his YouTube account as well for him, and automatically sends a notification to his YouTube followers to keep them up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Jack&#8217;s post turns out to be enormously popular, and starts a new wave of hamsterkitten fandom, earning him millions from the movie tie-ins and branding promotions.</p>\n<p>Despite the decentralised nature of WordPress sites, YouTube was able to work seamlessly with Jack&#8217;s site. It used WordPress.org as a middleman to bridge the gap, without sharing any private data with WordPress.org. It did this all while keeping the connection secure over insecure HTTP.</p>\n<h3>Jill, A Mobile Developer</h3>\n<p>On the other side of the world, Jill&#8217;s a mobile developer working on her first app. She&#8217;s heard all about this hamsterkitten craze, and has seen a business opportunity in creating a mobile app to post photos of them wherever you are in the world.</p>\n<p>Jill wants to be able to post to any WordPress site, but can&#8217;t go around and register her app on every site. Instead, she goes and registers her app on WordPress.org, which gives her access to every site with an extra step or two.</p>\n<p>While waiting for her app request to be approved, she sets up a new WordPress test site, which humorously uses the domain wassupwitd.at. (She knows that domain hacks are <em>so</em> early 2000s, but she still likes them.) She registers her client manually on her test site, which issues her with a client key and secret. She starts writing her client using these directly.</p>\n<p>Her client is a pretty basic wrapper around the Camera app that lets you upload directly to your site, but with some tricks up its sleeve. She adds some special functionality for sites with WooCommerce or EDD (which combined now represent 80% of online e-commerce), letting people create new products to sell their photos on their site, all from her app. She lets people upload multiple hamsterkitten photos at once, with support for creating sliders directly in the app.</p>\n<p>After not too long, her app request gets approved, and she&#8217;s given a key and secret to use with WordPress.org. She switches her app over to using those instead. Her app first talks to WordPress.org using this key and secret (hardcoded into the app), which then issues the app credentials for each site it accesses (stored inside the app).</p>\n<p>She wipes her test site and reinstalls it, now running stock WordPress with no real data in it. She hits the &#8220;Connect&#8221; button in her app, which sends her off to WordPress.org. WordPress.org hasn&#8217;t seen Jill before, so it asks her to enter her site&#8217;s address. She enters &#8220;wassupwitd.at&#8221; (laughing again to herself), then hits the continue button.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org hasn&#8217;t seen this site before, so it runs the auto-discovery process internally to find the site. It double-checks the authentication available there, then after making sure the site has the necessary bits enabled, asks the site to create client credentials for the app. It also redirects Jill off to the site.</p>\n<p>The site double-checks the validity of the client by sending a request to WordPress.org in the background, then creates a new client key and secret for the app. It passes these back to the app, and the two begin communicating directly.</p>\n<p>Jill hasn&#8217;t linked her app to this new test site before, so she sees the classic OAuth &#8220;Authorize This App&#8221; page on her site. After logging into her test site, she links the account to her app, and all is well with the world.</p>\n<p>Satisfied that the linking process is working for her, she gets ready to launch her app. She fills out her app details on WordPress.org to appear in the app directory, complete with a funky logo.</p>\n<p>However, disaster strikes! It turns out she made the mistake of posting her client credentials on a public GitHub repository. After reassurances from her colleagues and pets that everyone has done this at least once, she goes about setting it right.</p>\n<p>Her first step is to log on to WordPress.org and revoke her client key and secret from there. Internally, this does a few things. The first and main thing is that it stops clients from linking with new sites, since WordPress.org stops asking sites to issue new credentials when requested. This immediately stops the bleeding, but it doesn&#8217;t clean up any mess that&#8217;s already there.</p>\n<p>The next thing that happens is that WordPress.org adds the client key to the list of revoked clients. This is pulled down by sites automatically as part of their autoupdate check every day, and those sites revoke any credentials for the clients already on the site. This will make Jill&#8217;s site automatically revoke the previously issued client token in the next day, ensuring that it&#8217;s safe even if it&#8217;s already linked.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Jill, her app was still in testing, so there wasn&#8217;t a huge impact. If there was though, the WordPress security team could have assessed the issue to see how urgent it was. In urgent cases, they could check which sites have linked with the client previously and ping them via a backchannel to have them check the revocation list immediately instead. This would ensure maximum security for sites which are known to be affected.</p>\n<p>Now that she&#8217;s revoked her credentials and reissued new ones, she steadies herself, and launches the app. As it turns out, this app is exactly what the hamsterkitten community needed, and it surges to the top of the various app stores in mere hours. Jill goes to sleep that night confident that if any real security issues do pop up, she&#8217;s well-equipped to handle them, and the WordPress security team has her back.</p>\n<h3>Joe, A Server Administrator</h3>\n<p>Joe&#8217;s your regular sysops admin and developer, currently working with a Big Media organization to get their site up and running. He&#8217;s been paranoid about security ever since he left his laptop open at a conference and his colleagues made it yell his name every hour.</p>\n<p>The Big Media organization he&#8217;s working with wants to lock down the site to just a few applications, including their own custom one. Joe totally understands this, so he turns off the automatic client registration on the site. This stops the site from automatically creating credentials for clients registered on WordPress.org, and instead requires manual admin approval.</p>\n<p>He sets up the clients that the organization wants to use (including Kitstergram, Jill&#8217;s app) by running through the WordPress.org process and approving the clients with his administrator account. He then also manually sets up the client credentials for their custom app.</p>\n<p>He goes to bed that night knowing that the site and client are safe. If any problem pops up with Kitstergram, WordPress.org will handle the security for him, meaning he only needs to take care of the custom app security. Well, and his pet hamsterkitten.</p>\n<h3>Jenny, A Theme Developer</h3>\n<p>Themes have improved immensely in the past few years, with Jenny leading the charge through her theme company BooThemes. (As it turns out, spooky themes have really taken off in the past few years.) She&#8217;s been working on super-fast and immersive themes using the API.</p>\n<p>Some of the features that Jenny&#8217;s really proud of in her themes include live commenting and offline reading support. She also sells premium add-ons for bbPress and BuddyPress, which add tonnes of extra live features using their APIs.</p>\n<p>Despite writing themes that need to work across all the sites she interacts with, Jenny doesn&#8217;t worry about compatibility. Since the API is backwards compatible, she writes code for the latest version of WordPress and has it just work. She&#8217;s confident that any bugs will be fixed in the normal WordPress update process. Plus, having the API as part of WordPress core means she doesn&#8217;t have to worry about having her users run through a complex install process.</p>\n<h3>Ryan, An API Developer</h3>\n<p>After many years of working on the API, Ryan&#8217;s pleased that it&#8217;s finally been merged into core. Although it took a lot of hard work, it was worth all the effort after all. He now spends his time not worrying about which release of WordPress the API is going to be merged into.</p>\n<p>Of course, all these scenarios are just in Ryan&#8217;s head. He can be a little crazy at times. He can dream though, right?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 02:02:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Ryan McCue";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: WordPress.tv is Branching Out Into Beginner Tutorial Videos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45264";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-tv-is-branching-out-into-beginner-tutorial-videos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4299:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wordpress-tv.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wordpress-tv.png?resize=1025%2C440" alt="wordpress-tv" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45425" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.tv/" target="_blank">WordPress.tv</a> is expanding its video catalog beyond WordCamp session recordings. As most of the video content on the site centers around topics for developers and established users, the WPTV team is now <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/06/16/do-you-screencast-or-make-video-tutorials-of-how-to-use-wordpress-wordpress-tv-wants-you/" target="_blank">actively soliciting submissions</a> for more beginner video tutorials.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Are you a proud member of the WordPress community, who creates (or would like to create) videos that are focused on helping others learn how to use WordPress?

The WPTV team is hoping to add more &#8220;getting started&#8221; content that covers basic WordPress site management, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to configure widgets</li>\n<li>Setting up a custom menu</li>\n<li>Managing comments</li>\n<li>How to insert an image gallery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The initiative to add more beginner content is not new but failed to gain traction in previous attempts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Uptake was slow, so we thought it would be a good idea to give it a go again, and put a bit more structure to it,&#8221; WPTV contributor Jerry Bates said.</p>\n<p>One guideline in particular that was a sticking point the last time the group solicited tutorials was the requirement of no self-promotion or logos in the videos. Contributors have to submit their work for sheer love of the community, which makes it more difficult to gather submissions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>While we want you to be able to benefit from your work, WordPress.tv is a non-commercial community-run website; we can’t accept videos with watermarks, logos, or self-promotion of any kind. We do have a place for you to enter your WordPress.org profile name as a producer credit, so you will get noticed!</p></blockquote>\n<p>So far, the WPTV team has not received many submissions, but the demand for beginner content is there. According to Bates, some of the most viewed videos are consistently the beginner tutorials, despite the fact that they are outdated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a popular video type on YouTube and in for-pay training courses, but I think the greatest need is for foundation-level videos,&#8221; Bates said. &#8220;Anything that would help a new user on day one, week one, etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need more short and to-the-point tutorials,&#8221; WPTV crew member Michael Wiginton said. &#8220;Most will not want to watch a 45 minute video when trying to find an answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team is also experimenting with a plugin that would bring these tutorial videos into the WordPress dashboard, but the first step is to build a library of suitable beginner content.</p>\n<p>WordCamp recordings provide a never-ending funnel of content down to WordPress.tv, but only a small slice of these videos are useful for beginners. If WordPress is going to continue to grow its marketshare, the project cannot depend on only providing developer-oriented videos and education. A strong beginner tutorials section on WordPress.tv is a worthy project that will help support new users.</p>\n<p>The WPTV crew is a small team, averaging just 5-6 active volunteers. Creating and moderating videos is one unique way to contribute to the WordPress project that doesn&#8217;t require writing code.

The five-day drip content course is suitable for both plugin and theme developers and begins with instructions on how to structure your projects for an efficient Git workflow.</p>\n<p>While Git has many advanced features that could be overwhelming for beginners, the WP Git Crash Course only covers the ones that are directly relevant to WordPress development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, this course has two purposes,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;First of all, it is a way for me to establish a connection with visitors of my website who stop by without downloading WP Pusher.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Secondly, some people arrive on my website and like what they see but are not quite ready to start using WP Pusher because they need more knowledge about Git in order to get started. The course should get them up to speed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As Suhm&#8217;s WP Pusher product manages <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github" target="_blank">deployment of WordPress themes and plugins from GitHub</a>, Git educational resources are a natural extension of his work.</p>\n<p>The crash course introduces Suhm&#8217;s recommended workflow but doesn&#8217;t force the user into a rigid method of structuring projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have concluded that maybe it is okay that people do things differently than me (but please do not keep your whole WordPress installation under version control!),&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I launched WP Pusher it was very opinionated and only supported my way of keeping WordPress under version control. Today it is much more flexible and works even if you keep multiple plugins or themes in one repository &#8211; something I would have sworn to never support.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Suhm is passionate about development best practices and workflow and often <a href="http://blog.wppusher.com/" target="_blank">blogs on these topics</a>. As a newcomer to the WordPress community, he offers a unique perspective.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the Laravel community, we see many new arrivals of people from the world of WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For me it is the opposite. I am reentering the WordPress community after years of working with Laravel and Symfony, and I actually think I can bring something new to the table.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Aside from freelance work he did years ago, WP Pusher is Suhm&#8217;s first real venture into the WordPress world. After just five months, he&#8217;s pleased with how well his plugin has been received.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been lucky enough to meet a lot of great people in the WordPress community, both IRL and online,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some of them have been extremely supportive and generously shared their experiences with me, which has really given me a head start.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Suhm is determined to keep creating educational content for the WordPress community and will be running the Git crash course for as long as people are interested. The course is not a complete, extensive guide to Git, as it just touches the surface. He plans to update it to add more advanced topics once he receives more feedback.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re just getting started integrating Git into your workflow for WordPress development, this crash course is a handy, concise resource for getting up to speed.

Here in the valley many schools are not up to the specks that many of us would like. It is important that we consider how to address the issues of underfunded schools by first asking the question, where is the funding going? In many cases the funding that schools receive goes to pay expenses like lighting and heating. With many of the schools that we have seen most of them overpay in utilities or there is simply to much waste within the schools themselves that allocated budgets simply can''t cover everything.</p><p>There is good news, <a href="http://henergy.wpengine.com/">Highlands Energy Services</a> is here to help serve the Central Valley because we work with major utility providers to lower the amount of energy and other resources that school use.

This however is not the case, and can cause your HVAC to work harder and longer than necessary. Additionally, the mistake can be made when a building is set to be cooled or heated when nobody is there to use it, such as overnight or during weekends. Programmable thermostats can eliminate this problem with timers that will automatically adjust temperatures so energy is only being used when you need it.</p>[/tw_column]</div><div class="row">[tw_column title="Improper%20Maitenence" size="col-md-12" class="" layout_size="col-md-12" row_type="row" animation="none" animation_delay=""]<p>Uncleaned or old air filters can drastically reduce the efficiency of your HVAC. By keeping things routinely maintained, energy efficiency can be increased by up to 15%. Similarly, old and out-of-date systems simply aren''t as energy efficient as newer models, and may need to be replaced.</p>[/tw_column]</div>[/tw_layout]</div></div></div><div class="row-container light bg-parallax" style="background-image:url(http://henergy.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/solar-parallax2.jpg);"><div class="container"><div class="row">[tw_layout bg_type="parallax" size="col-md-12" layout_custom_class=""]<div class="row">[tw_callout title="" size="col-md-12" class="" layout_size="col-md-12" row_type="row" animation="none" animation_delay="" text="People Choose Highlands For Our Free Comprehensive Efficiency And Safety Audit" bg_color=" " font_size="18" btn_text="Get Started" btn_color="#16d1ac" btn_icon="" btn_url="http://henergy.wpengine.com/?page_id=1674" btn_target="_blank"][/tw_callout]</div>[/tw_layout]</div></div></div>'),

It was added to quicken the drying process, repel moisture, and increase durability. However, lead has since been found to be a hazardous material, and can cause many illnesses, including nervous system damage, kidney growth, reproductive issues, amongst other health concerns. If a building is found to have lead paint, steps must be taken to ensure proper removal.</p>[/tw_column][tw_column title="Safety%20Concerns" size="col-md-4" class="" layout_size="col-md-12" row_type="row" animation="none" animation_delay=""]<p>Improper removal of lead paint can sometimes worsen the situation if certain precautions are not taken.

In the case of building materials, it can take very little wear and tear for asbestos fibers to become airborne, entering the respiratory system or attaching onto skin or clothing. An second hand risk comes up when a person in contact with asbestos then returns home, as fibers clinging to the body can become airborne, affecting those at home.</p><p>The most well known illnesses associated with asbestos exposure is asbestosis, a chronic lung disease that causes scarring of the lung tissue, and mesothelioma lung cancer.</p>[/tw_column]</div><div class="row">[tw_column title="Asbestos%20in%20Schools" size="col-md-12" class="" layout_size="col-md-12" row_type="row" animation="none" animation_delay=""]<p>Unless a school is newly built, chances are it will contain some form of asbestos, typically in the insulation. 50% of school buildings currently in use in the United state were constructed between 1950 and 1970, which were peak years for asbestos usage.

That included benchmarking existing buildings, walk-through surveys, gathering a comprehensive list of additional funding sources to offset project costs and produce the school district’s Energy Expenditure Plan for submission to the California Energy Commission (CEC). On July 8, 2014, Highlands Energy, with nearly 30 years of experience in assessing, recommending and implementing projects, provided its findings and recommendations to the school district in preparation for fixes and improvements related to Proposition 39, the California Clean Energy Jobs Act.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Highlands Energy started with its Level 1 audit. It consisted of brief interviews with site operating personnel, a review of the facility’s utility bills and an abbreviated walkthrough of the site. This was done to get a quick understanding of the buildings and energy systems in order to identify the potential for energy improvements and how the facility performs relative to its peers. The next two audits were conducted to give more detailed looks at problems, solutions and potential improvements. Here, the school district was informed of all of this and given an economic breakdown of certain work as well as ways to offset costs through grants and/or bonds.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">When Highlands Energy sent surveyors to this District, they found a number of potential energy-saving improvements that could be made and some hazardous materials that needed to be extracted. Some of those included:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*A total of six HVAC units were on site, one of which provided conditioned air to the kitchen and gymnasium but was completely inoperable. The recommendation was to replace the six units with 14 SEER-rated systems that run more efficiently, reducing electricity consumption and costs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*Portions of the duct system had significant gaps that allowed air to escape. Duct tape was not a solution as it becomes brittle and breaks. Instead, Highlands Energy recommended sealing ducts and HVAC systems with butyl tape and mastic for a more secure seal. This eliminates loss of conditioned air and improves air quality. This would save on electrical consumption and costs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*Chipped paint was found in two rooms over 2,185 square feet on secondary ceilings. It was determined the paint on the ceilings could be lead based, according to the year of construction. Also, the ceiling had ill-fitting duct work and holes. Highland Energy suggested replacing drywall around the duct for a more proper fit, allowing the HVAC system to work more efficiently and rooms to maintain temperature. Also, eliminating any paint from 1978 and before because of lead concerns.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*The buildings had 11 manual thermostats, but replacing those with programmable thermostats allows for better utilization of HVAC systems. Again, this means more efficient consumption and lower costs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*The 412 32-watt lamps in the school should be replaced with 28-watt lamps to reduce consumption and costs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*There were 409 square feet of single-pane aluminum windows, and we recommended replacing those with dual-pan Low-E vinyl windows. This helps keep conditioned air in the rooms and temperatures stable, allowing less use of the HVAC systems in order to drop energy costs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*Replacing two tanked water heaters with tankless water heaters, which on average are 22 percent more efficient.</p>', 'Discovering Energy Efficiency in Central Valley Schools', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'discovering-energy-efficiency-in-central-valley-schools', '', '', '2014-08-11 22:45:49', '2014-08-11 22:45:49', '', 0, 'http://henergy.wpengine.com/?p=2240', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(2254, 2, '2014-07-23 22:54:39', '2014-07-23 22:54:39', 'Why are we here? This is a question that I repeatedly ask myself. Why are we here, in this place, doing this business, serving the clients that we serve? This is fundamental question that must be answered in order for there to be purpose and intention in all that we do. For me, I keep going back to a story in the Bible that I believe best illustrates why we are here.\r\n\r\nThere was a man traveling a dangerous road. The road was known to be home to thieves and murderous men. While on his journey, the man fell victim to the treachery of the road. He was robbed, beaten, stripped of his clothes and left to die. Another man soon came down the same road. He was a great leader in his community. When he came upon the man on the side of the road, he chose to cross the road, ignore his neighbor and continue on his way. Another man soon followed and seeing what his leader had done, he also crossed and continued on his way. Then a third man came along the same road. Seeing the man on the side of the road, he was filled with compassion. He stopped, bandaged his wounds, took him to the nearest town and paid for his full recovery. Does the story sound familiar? It is a story that Jesus told to describe what it looks like to be a good neighbor; to love our neighbor. I believe it also answers our “why” question.\r\n\r\nThis is why we are here; to love our neighbor, to be good neighbors in our communities and in our cities. Our purpose is to love God and to love others. Everything we do should be in an effort to fulfill this purpose. Whether we are weatherizing homes, processing payroll, entering home assessment forms, answering a phone or meeting with a new homeowner, we should always keep our purpose in mind. Our purpose will give us clarity in the midst of uncertainty, focus when distractions surround, and inspiration when we are weary. How are we different? There are only 6 degrees of separation between us and most other well ran organizations in our industries. However, I believe the distinction is enough to separate us from the rest of the competitive field by miles and miles. \r\n\r\nWhen we serve, we are putting someone else’s interest ahead of our own. This is clearly evident in our story. The good neighbor puts the interest of the man on the side of the road ahead of his own. As I stated earlier, he doesn’t think twice about stopping to help him. It is impossible to ignore serving when you have a servant’s heart. Serving others has become a lost art and maybe it’s because business has changed. With so much business now being done online, it is no longer necessary to truly “serve” someone to earn his or her business. Good customer service is now measured by how quickly I get my package and not by how well one knows the customer. Well we are still in the people business, or better put, we are in the business of people; helping people, serving people. Let’s learn our client’s names, what they like, what they don’t like. Let’s put our self in their shoes and walk a mile. Let’s treat them the way we would like to be treated. That, after all is what being a good neighbor is all about right, treating others the way we want to be treated.\r\n\r\nIn Martin Luther King Jr''s message "The Good Neighbor" he is quoted as saying, “We have all been called to pull our brother from the ditch. But at some point, we just need to fix that road to Jericho!” I think what he was communicating to his listener was that it is okay to help others directly by meeting direct needs, feeding the hungry clothing the naked. In our case it would be helping families save money on their utility bills or helping contractors deliver quality trade services or by helping first time home buyers successfully close escrow on their first home. But at some point, we need to look at how we can help fix a system that creates inequalities in the quality of life for our neighbors in our communities.

(2260, 2, '2014-07-24 19:19:28', '2014-07-24 19:19:28', 'A Fresno County School District selected <a href="http://henergy.wpengine.com/">Highlands Energy</a> to conduct a Level II energy audit of its facilities in preparation for funding from <a href="http://henergy.wpengine.com/prop-39-schools/">Proposition 39</a>, the California Clean Energy Jobs act aimed at improving energy efficiency in schools. The California Department of Education outlined the importance of these kinds of improvements, stating, “Improving a school’s Overall Compliance Rating to meet health and safety standards can lead to a 36-point increase in California Academic Performance Index scores.” The <a href="http://henergy.wpengine.com/prop-39-schools/">Level II audit</a>, preceded by a Level I “simple” or “walk-through” audit, included a detailed evaluation of the Level I findings to define a variety of potential energy-efficiency improvements, a detailed analysis of the facilities’ energy consumption as well as evaluations of lighting, air quality, temperature, ventilation, humidity and other conditions that might affect performance. The report also included a concise briefing of a variety of Energy Efficiency Measures and how to fix or improve conditions as well as cost-cutting measures through grants and bonds.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://henergy.wpengine.com/">Highlands Energy</a>, a respected company with nearly 30 years experience in assessing, recommending and implementing these kinds of projects, provided its Level II audit findings on July 22, 2014.Here are parts of the findings:\r\n\r\n*One of the more appalling discoveries was a non-working forced-air unit in the cafeteria. It was missing the front cover, exposing live electrical wire. Coming into contact with this could easily result in electrical shock and possibly death. It is also a serious fire hazard. Highlands’ surveyors recommended immediately turning off power to the unit and having it red tagged by an <a href="http://henergy.wpengine.com/prop-39-schools/">HVAC</a> technician to eliminate potential for injury, shock or fire.\r\n\r\n*Broken single-pan glass was another hazard discovered. The cafeteria, kitchen and boys and girls restrooms had cracked/broken panes that could lead to serious injuries for staff and students. Replacing the hazards with vinyl Low-E windows would increase energy efficiency and safety.\r\n\r\n*Moisture and mold were discovered during visual inspections under forced-air units. The condensation pumps were not operating properly, causing the pumps’ reservoirs to overflow and mold and moister marks to develop in the FAU enclosure. Pools of water were also discovered. The audit recommended servicing or replacing the pumps, checking for obstructions in the condensation lines and sanitizing any surface with mold growth. Failing to address these problems will result in health and structural problems.\r\n\r\n*Girls and boys restrooms had leaky toilets and some were continuously running. Some plumbing fixtures, such as a sink in the girls restroom, were damaged and hazardous to students. The fixtures need to be replaced with water-efficient plumbing and hardware.\r\n\r\n*There were a number of inefficient light fixtures in and around the facility. Replacing the lamps with more efficient alternatives would save energy consumption and money. Also, replacing some of the outdoor lamps would not only reduce consumption but provide better lighting coverage for increased safety and security. There were a number of other potential improvements that could save the school energy and money, including inefficient water heaters, cooling and heating units and uninsulated ceilings. A management phase was another part of Highlands Energy’s audit. This helps educate and train school district personnel on how to manage their new systems, a requirement for Proposition 39 grants. Highlands Energy tailors each management phase to fit each facility’s specific needs. Maintenance and compliance is also part of the training.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as part of the plan’s “Fund Sourcing” section, Highlands Energy provided a case study for the County of Contra Costa, which used two loans from the California Energy Commission and its own funds to retrofit and upgrade heating and cooling systems in eight buildings. The study broke down costs and how much money could be saved annually to show the advantages of such improvements. The ASHRAE Level II <em>Plus</em> audit for this District was 47 pages and provided comprehensive breakdowns of problems, solutions, improvements, costs and funding.', 'Clean Energy in California Schools', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'clean-energy-in-central-valley-schools', '', '', '2014-08-11 22:45:15', '2014-08-11 22:45:15', '', 0, 'http://henergy.wpengine.com/?p=2260', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It''s only march and yet we''ve already seen 90-degree weather. So in the summer, with the AC going, many residents find that their energy bills skyrocket. To help alleviate this problem, we''ve compiled a list of tips and tricks to help reduce your energy usage and keep costs down.\r\n\r\n<h3>Don''t just turn off unused appliances- unplug them</h3>\r\nThis tip is one of the most well known, and it can be extremely effective. If you aren''t currently using a device or charger, unplug it! Even when not in use, phone or other battery chargers, microwave, toaster, and other small small appliances combined can use as much energy daily as a refrigerator.\r\n\r\n<h3>Speaking of the Refrigerator...</h3>\r\nTake a look in your fridge and freezer. Is there a lot of frost? A buildup of frost can drastically reduce the efficiency of your units. Clean out that frost regularly, and don''t allow it to build up to more than 1/4 of an inch.\r\n\r\nAlso, fill your fridge up! It may seem counter-intuitive, but having your fridge packed full prevents it from warming up too fast when opening the door. This means it doesn''t have to work as hard to keep cool as you''re going in and out throughout the day.\r\n\r\nMake sure that you cover or wrap up foods or liquids left in your refrigerator. Uncovered items can release moisture, forcing your refrigerator''s compressor to work overtime to keep things dry and cool.\r\n\r\n<h3>Laundry</h3>\r\nBe sure to clean your lint trap after each and every load. Also, avoid running half-loads. Run full loads and, if your dryer has one, use the moisture-sensing setting. This can help save 5% on your energy bill.\r\n\r\n<h3>Make the Most of Grill Season</h3>\r\nIf possible, avoid using your oven during the hotter months. The heat generated forces your AC to work harder and longer to keep things cool. Try using a smaller toaster oven, a crock pot, stove top, or grill outdoors. If you do need to use your oven, try to limit your usage to the morning or evenings, when it is cooler outside.\r\n\r\n<h3>Beat the Heat</h3>\r\nDon''t just rely on your AC to keep things cool. Use your ceiling fans to create a cool breeze. If you raise your thermostat by only two degrees and use your ceiling fan, you can lower cooling costs by up to 14 percent. Keep your window coverings closed during the daytime to help block out heat from the sun. Before you head out for work, turn your thermostat up so your AC isn''t cooling an empty house.\r\n\r\nWant to learn more about how to reduce your energy costs? <a href="http://henergy.staging.wpengine.com/contact-2/" title="Contact">Contact us</a> or request an <a href="http://henergy.staging.wpengine.com/contact-2/energy-audit/" title="Request Audit">energy audit</a> to identify where your home or business could be saving energy.', 'Keep Cool and Cut Energy Costs', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'keep-cool-and-cut-energy-costs', '', '', '2015-03-27 18:39:34', '2015-03-27 18:39:34', '', 0, 'http://henergy.staging.wpengine.com/?p=2335', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The State of California was responsible for more than half of that growth, with about 3,550 MWh of capacity installed, according to a report by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association.\r\n\r\nAs recently announced by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), California now ranks 1st in the country for installed solar capacity, with a total capacity of 9,977 MWh currently installed. There is now enough solar energy installed in the state to power over 2.4 million homes.

Here''s some tips for conserving water at your own home:</h4>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Turn off the faucet while brushing teeth and/or shaving.</em></strong> This is one of the easiest ways to reduce water usage, and can actually save you up to 3,000 gallons per year!\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Only run full loads</em></strong> in your dishwasher and washing machine. Speaking of dishes, many dishwashers actually use <em>less</em> water than washing by hand. If you do wash by hand, however, don''t leave the tap running. Instead, fill one basin with soapy water for scrubbing, and the other with clean rinse water.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Install water efficient fixtures and appliances.</em></strong> Look for faucets, shower heads, toilets, and other water-using appliances with WaterSense and EnergyStar labels.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Shorten your showers.</em></strong> While it is generally recommended to limit your showers to 5 minutes, even shortening your shower time by 1-2 minutes can save you 150 gallons each month. Also, consider turning the water off while lathering your hair or body.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Place a few drops of food coloring in your toilet''s reservoir.</strong></em> If any color seeps into the bowl without flushing, there''s a leak that needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Collect spare water,</em></strong> such as from rinsing fruits and vegetables, dropped ice cubes, water ran while waiting for cool/hot water, etc, into a bowl or bucket and use it to water houseplants or your garden.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Re-use the waste water from cleaning fishtanks.</em></strong> Use this nutrient-rich water for outdoor, non-edible plants.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Limit your lawn watering</em></strong> and monitor runoff. Apply water only as fast as the soil can absorb it. If you notice water running over your sidewalk or into the street, lessen the amount you''re using. Aerating your lawn by putting in holes every 6 inches will allow more water to be absorbed, and also ensures that more water reaches the roots.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Install gutters and waterspouts</em></strong> to collect any runoff water from your roof when it does rain. Direct the waterspouts into large buckets or rain barrels to then use to water your lawn and garden, or straight onto water-needy plants or trees.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>If you own a pool,</em></strong> invest in a pool cover to not only keep out debris, but to limit water loss from evaporation, and reduce chemical use.\r\n\r\nLastly, <strong><em>check faucets, pipes, sprinklers, and appliances regularly for leaks.</em></strong> A faucet that drips once per second can waste approximately 5 gallons/day.', 'Water Conservation Tips for 2015', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'water-conservation-tips-for-2015', '', '', '2015-04-21 18:58:59', '2015-04-21 18:58:59', '', 0, 'http://henergy.staging.wpengine.com/?p=2338', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Flex Alerts are typically put out when there is a high forecasted peaks in demand or when there are low power reserves caused by heat waves, storms, or unplanned generator outages. If this happens, a voluntary call is sent out to Californians to follow these steps:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Turn of all unnecessary lights, computers, and appliances.</li>\r\n<li>Postpone usage of major appliances until 6 pm.</li>\r\n<li>Turn your air conditioning thermostat to 78&deg;F or higher.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nIn the past years, Californians participating in the Flex Alert program have achieved high levels of conservation during heat waves and other risks to the electric grid such as wildfires or when major power plants or power lines are unavailable.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that there will be a greater risk this year for rolling blackouts and power shortages. The main reasons include an overlapping of two major hazards: the historic drought, and approaching heat storms.\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommended for all California residents to sign up and participate in energy conservation when a Flex Alert is called.

But it''s not just large solar operations that make California a leader in solar energy: it''s the residential installations as well.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that nearly a quarter of a million homes in California have solar panels installed, and that number is expected to jump even further. Most companies offer some sort of incentive or rebate system, and many households are even eligible for governmental assistance if they wish to go solar. There are also volunteer organizations dedicated to installing solar panels in low-income areas, often paying some or all of the costs of the panels, and having volunteer contractors do the installations for free.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://henergy.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla-power-demand-illo-300x205.jpg" alt="Solar Generation vs Peak Demand" width="300" height="205" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2347" />Advances in technology are also making it easier for homeowners to make the switch. Solar panels are more efficient than ever generating more electricity per solar cell, not to mention the launch of Tesla''s home batteries has the world buzzing. It creates a new opportunity to store the excess solar energy generated during the day to save for use during times when solar production isn''t as high, creating a solution to the "no sun, no power" problem that was a major hangup with those considering solar energy. This chart, right, credit of extremetech.com, charts solar generation capacity vs peak times of energy use. Storage of the excess solar power generated during the day to use during other parts of the day allows homeowners to become more self-sustaining, and less reliant on the power grid.\r\n\r\nThe State of California has a goal set for 25% of its energy to come from renewable sources by 2016, and then up to 33% by 2020.

Here''s some of those energy savings myths:\r\n\r\n<h5><i class="fa fa-moon-o" style="font-size:30px;margin-right:10px;"></i> Energy Savings Myth #1: Keeping your thermostat at the same temperature day and night uses less energy than turning it down at night and heating your room up again in the morning.</h5>\r\nFalse. It takes less energy to warm up a cold room than it does to keep a room heated all night. The same is true for the reverse in summer, it takes less energy to cool down a warm room than it does to keep it cool all night.\r\n\r\n<h5><i class="fa fa-clock-o" style="font-size:30px;margin-right:10px;"></i> Energy Savings Myth #2: Setting your air-conditioner thermostat to a lower temperature when you start it will cool your room faster.</h5>\r\nFalse. Even when you set your air conditioner at a lower temperature, it will still cool the room at the same rate. In the end it will result in a lower temperature, but it will take longer to get to that point. Again, this is the case for the reverse. Even if you set your thermostat higher in the winter, your room will not warm up any faster.\r\n\r\n<h5><i class="fa fa-bolt" style="font-size:30px;margin-right:10px;"></i> Energy Savings Myth #3: Appliances don’t use energy when they are turned off.</h5>\r\nWhile this may have been true for older appliances, for the majority of modern appliances this is false. Most appliances have standy-by power settings that are in effect even when the appliance is supposedly turned off. These features are typically included for convenience''s sake, allowing for shorter startup times when powering on an appliance. Unless it is an appliance that you use frequently throughout the day, consider unplugging the appliance completely or utilizing a power strip with a shut-off switch for multiple appliances.\r\n\r\n<h5><i class="fa fa-power-off" style="font-size:30px;margin-right:10px;"></i> Energy Savings Myth #4: Sleep mode or hibernate is fine for leaving your computers overnight.</h5>\r\nFalse. Leaving your computer on sleep mode still uses a lot of energy, because your computer is essentially still on. While it does use slightly less energy than leaving it completely on, if you''re logging off for the night or for more than an hour or so, it''s best to completely shut it down.\r\n\r\n<h5><i class="fa fa-desktop" style="font-size:30px;margin-right:10px;"></i> Energy Savings Myth #5: Screen savers save energy.</h5>\r\nFalse. The original purpose of a screen saver was to avoid an image displayed on an older monitor from being "burnt into" the screen. Modern monitors and display screens no longer have this problem. A computer running a screen saver uses the same amount of power as it would any other time. The only exception to this is a screen "time-out"; when a monitor turns off when the computer is not in use. Even so, this only slightly reduces a computer''s energy consumption, so if you aren''t going to be using your computer for a while, you should shut it down completely.\r\n\r\n<h5><i class="fa fa-tint" style="font-size:30px;margin-right:10px;"></i> Energy Savings Myth #6: A little leak is not a major issue.</h5>\r\nFalse. A faucet that drips just once per second can waste 100 gallons per month. The problem is worse if it is hot water that is leaking, as this creates extra work for your hot water heater, costing you now in both wasted water and wasted energy. If you notice a faucet is leaking, it is best to fix it right away. Sometimes a $0.50 washer is all you need.\r\n\r\n<h5><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o" style="font-size:30px;margin-right:10px;"></i> Energy Savings Myth #7: Leaving a light on uses less energy than turning it on and off multiple times.</h5>\r\nFalse. While older lightbulbs could potentially get worn out from constantly turning on and off, this is not true for today''s lightbulbs. It''s always a good idea to turn off the lights in a room that you are not using, even if you are planning on coming back in just a few minutes. Try to get into the habit of turning off the lights whenever you leave a room.\r\n\r\n<h5><i class="fa fa-plus-square-o" style="font-size:30px;margin-right:10px;"></i> Energy Savings Myth #8: Insulating the ceiling will just cause more heat to leak out of the windows.</h5>\r\nUnless your home is highly pressurized (hint: it''s not), adding extra insulation anywhere in your home is not going to force air out of other places.', '8 Energy Savings Myths', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', '8-energy-savings-myths', '', '', '2015-06-05 22:18:31', '2015-06-05 22:18:31', '', 0, 'http://henergy.staging.wpengine.com/?p=2391', 0, 'post', '', 0),
